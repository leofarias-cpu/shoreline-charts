# Colors

Colors are used to reflect a product's style with consistency across all components used on the Admin UI. Each color has some specific function when applied to an element on the screen. The following concepts are part of our efforts to make the user interface harmonious and consistent. We are committed to complying with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines AA standard contrast ratios](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/).

## Primary Color

We use **blue.40** for primary actions (which will move the user forward in the flow) like buttons, text links, etc., and interactive elements like element selection, drag states, etc. Elements that are not actionable or interacting must not use this color.

### Do

- Use blue.40 for primary actions, links, active and selected states.

### Don'ts

- Do not use blue.40 for highlighting information. Because using this color for actions may confuse when used on something like highlighting some information or text.

- Do not use blue.40 for the color of the backgrounds. It can interfere with the visual priorities on the page and draw attention to non-action elements. Generally, buttons should be the only elements with dark backgrounds. Nothing on the page should draw attention away from them.

## Semantic Colors

Semantic colors help users identify status, feedback, and informational elements in the interface. Consistent use of color keeps the cognitive load low and contributes to a unified and engaging user experience.

### Green

- Use to represent confirmation actions, success messages, and status (completed, paid, added, etc.).

### Orange:

- Use to represent warning actions, warning messages, and status.

### Red

- Use to represent remove, delete, error messages, and status (canceled, failed) actions.

### Blue Light

- Use to represent information feedbacks.

## Foreground

We have two color options for text on the Admin UI:

- black: Use for main text.
- grey.50: Use for secondary texts, which have a lower weight of importance than main texts, such as captions, subtitles, descriptions, etc.

## Background

Nós usamos duas cores principais para background:

- white: Utilize como fundo principal nas interfaces do Admin.
- grey10: Utilize para destacar o fundo em algum cenário específico como o caso sidebar.

Quatro cores para criar backgrounds semânticos para sinalizar status e/ou alerts:

blue-light.05: usado para alertas que representem feedbacks de informação.
green,05: usado para status e/ou alertas que representem feedbacks de sucessos.
red,05: usado paraa status e/ou alertas que representem feedbacks de erros.
yellow.05 : usado para status e/ou alertas que representem feedbacks de atenção.
