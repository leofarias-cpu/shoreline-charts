<OrderedList>
  <OrderedListItem>
    Read the template's documentation.
  </OrderedListItem>
  <OrderedListItem>
    Create a copy of the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/M4O0WAcWAZ7eUDPPWH6mu3/Form-Page-Template?node-id=504%3A208847&t=LucYA5v4whGFbT5q-1">Figma file</a>, so you can get started with your own version.
  </OrderedListItem>
  <OrderedListItem>
Make the desired changes to content and components. Make sure you access our components' documentation to learn more about each one.
  </OrderedListItem>
  <OrderedListItem>
    Share your version of the prototype with the developers in your team.

## Variants

<br />

#### When to use sections in a form?

- Use sections for forms with more than five fields, when the fields can grouped in a way that makes sense to merchants and won't disrupt their experience. For example, it makes sense to group the fields for an address in a section.

**What to avoid:**

- Don't include fields and lists with referenced objects in the same section.
- Don't include conditional fields and non-conditional fields in the same section.

<br />

## Position

<br />

#### What should be the order of the form sections?

Order them using the following criteria:

  - More general to more specific.
  - Required to optional.
  - Most important to least important.

<br />

#### What should be the order of input fields and controls in a section?

Order them using the following criteria:

  - More general to more specific.
  - Required to optional.
  - Most important to least important.

Read each field or control component’s documentation for further information.

<br />

## Behavior

<br />

#### What is the input fields' behavior?

If you want to know what is the behavior of input fields in a Form, read the **Behavior** section in the component’s documentation.

<br />

#### What is the controls’ behavior?

If you want to know what is the behavior of controls in a Form, read the **Behavior** section in the component’s documentation.

<br />

#### When to use conditional fields?

  - Conditional fields are fields that become visible or are hidden depending on the value of a control field.
  - Use a [Switch](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/switch) to control the visibility of sections and fields during a progressive fill.
  - Use a [Radio](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/radio) to choose among options that will affect the following fields to be filled. For example, the form for creating a promotion can have conditional fields based on the type of promotion that was chosen.

<br />

## Content

<br />

#### What should be the page title, URL route and Admin navigation entry?

- When an existing object is being edited, include the name of the object in the page title, URL route and Admin navigation entry, such as *Christmas Discount.*
- When a new object is being created, use the word *New* and the name of the entity, such as *New Product.*

<br />

#### What actions should be in the header of a form page?

- Include a tertiary [Button](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/button) that leads back to the first-level page with the icon *ArrowLeft* and the hidden label *Back*.
- Include a primary [Button](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/button) to save the data with the label *Save*.
- Include a secondary [Button](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/button) to discard unsaved changes and leave the flow with the label *Cancel*.
- For objects that have already been created, include a Menu with actions such as *Export* and *Delete* when editing.

<br />

#### What should be the title of a form section?

- When the form has more than one section, it is recommended to use a title in all sections to describe the content of each one.
- A form section title should explain the type of information the merchant will input or select in the following group of fields and controls. For example, use the *Address* label to group address-related fields.
- Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.

**What to avoid:**

- When the form has only one section, do not use the title in the section, use the page title to describe it.
- Don't include redundant words. Example: in a Form called *New Store*, do not name the form section *Store Address*, use only *Address*.
- Don't use verbs. For example, instead of *Select address*, use only *Address.*
- Don't use punctuation.

<br />

#### What should be the description of a form section?

- In most cases, the form section title should be self explanatory. Add a description if the form section is critical or complex.
- Write the description text as if you are answering the following question: *What does this mean?* For example, for an *Address* section, the description text can be *Location of the store.*
- Start with a noun followed by additional information, such as conditions and definitions.
- Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.
- Prefer using a single sentence that is short and direct.

**What to avoid:**

- Don’t write text longer than 110 characters.
- Don’t repeat the form title.
- Don’t explain the benefits of the content, only its meaning.
- Don’t use periods.

<br />

#### What should be the content of a form section?

- The content of a form section is basically input fields and controls. Access each component’s documentation for further information:
    - **Input fields**: [TextInput](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/text-input), [TextArea](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/text-area), [NumberInput](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/number-input), [DatePicker](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/experimental/date-picker) and [Combobox](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/experimental/combobox).
    - **Controls**: [Checkbox](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/checkbox), [Radio](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/radio), [Select](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/select) and [Switch](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/switch).
- Use a list section when the merchant can add sub-items or references to the main form. In that case, use [Modals](https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/modal) to add or select items for the list. Such as, when the merchant adds a user in a list of users when create a user role.
