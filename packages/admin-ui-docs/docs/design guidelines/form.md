## Design recommendations for Form

Follow the set of recommendations below to make the best decisions when designing sleek, clear pages. This page includes recomendations for the following components:
- Toggle/Switch
- Radio
- Choice List
- Select
- Number Field
- Text Field
- Checkbox
- Date Picker
- Multiselect
- Combobox


## Best practices and general recommendations:

- Sections should have at least three fields.
- Use section description only when necessary and the additional content is essential.
- If there’s only one section in a page, no section header should exist.

## MultiSelect (to be implemented)

- Use when multiple options need to be selected from a list larger than 7, or from a dynamic list of any size.
- Example

## Combobox

- Use when a single option needs to be chosen for a very large list >20, or when the options are dynamic
- Example
- Avoid help texts with more than one sentence.

## Toggle/Switch

- Only when semantic is on/off
- Switch label should be written sho it’s inactive by default.
- Use a disabled switch only if in some condition it becomes enabled. Avoid multiple disabled inputs in the same screen.
- Look for labels that are already used in other admins and avoid using new terms when the semantic is very similar.
- Start labels with verbs.

## Radio

- Ideally, one option should become checked by default.
- Use a disabled radio only if in some condition it becomes enabled. Avoid multiple disabled inputs in the same screen.

## Text Field

- A specific format should not be required. If a specific format is required explain in a help text.
- Avoid help texts with more than one sentence.
- Use a disabled input only if in some condition it becomes enabled. Avoid multiple disabled inputs in the same screen.
- Look for labels that are already used in other admins and avoid using new terms when the semantic is very similar.

## Checkbox

- Checkbox label should be written so it’s unchecked by default.
- Use a disabled checkbox only if in some condition it becomes enabled. Avoid multiple disabled inputs in the same screen.
- Look for labels that are already used in other admins and avoid using new terms when the semantic is very similar.
