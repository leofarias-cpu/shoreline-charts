We can support your team from early-stage designs to launching a product.

## Our role in your project

One of the goals of the Admin UI team is to **support** other teams while they are designing their products, since the early design stages, through a partnership that results in more consistent products.

### What kind of support can you expect from us?

- Receive constructive feedback related to how Admin UI patterns and components are applied, and how their customizations can consistently adopt Admin UI foundations.
- Give feedback on patterns, components and resources in general.
- Suggest new components or patterns that have proven necessary to provide a good experience for merchants.
- Get help on how design can be implemented, including what can be leveraged from Admin UI and what will need to be implemented from scratch.
- Clarify any questions related to Admin UI resources.

### What shouldn't you expect from us?

- To be a bottleneck for products to be shipped.
- To question the feature's or product's motivation.
- To be a blocker for customization and experimentation.

:::info tip

We recommend that teams without an allocated designer look for one who can be responsible for helping with internal alignments and QA.

## How to have our support

- [Schedule a meeting](https://calendar.app.google/FSWwjbydU9TxE9HF6) in one of our 1 hour slots available on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Designers and developers are welcome.
- If you have a quick question, you can still find us on Slack at #admin-ui.

## When to have our support

### Early-stage design

When there are some early designs and expectations related to necessary interfaces and components. You may introduce your project to us and clarify some initial questions on how to use the Admin UI resources, components availability and customization, and information architecture.

### Medium to high-fidelity design

When you need to review or clarify any questions related to patterns in general, components, customization, copy, usability, implementation or any other design consideration.

### Handoff

When there are still some implementation questions left. Ideally, in this step, all questions related to design patterns should have already been clarified. This step may require the presence of both front-end developers from the Admin UI and your team since it can be a more technical conversation.

### Before launching

The design QA during implementation is still your responsibility. We will do an asynchronous final review to check for minor non-blocking issues.
