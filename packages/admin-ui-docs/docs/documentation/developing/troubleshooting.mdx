### Admin UI 0.136.0 doesn't work on VTEX IO projects

When updating to version `0.136.0`, an error occur due to the version of an internally used library. To fix this error, it's necessary to update to version `0.136.1` and above. You can also use [yarn resolutions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/) to indicate a valid version of the internal dependency, and solve the issue. You can do this by adding the following code snippet to the `package.json` of your React folder:

```json
// react/package.json
{
  // all the other configurations
  "resolutions": {
    "ariakit": "2.0.0-next.39"
  }
}
```
