`Skeleton` is a versatile primitive component, with no defined style, that can be used to leverage UIs that don't contain actual content yet. Instead, it shows the loading elements of a page in a shape similar to the actual content. Other use cases include:

- It shows users that content is loading, offering a vague preview of how content will look once it fully loads.
- It is also used internally by AdminUI to handle the loading state of specific components.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Skeleton } from '@vtex/admin-ui'

export Example() {
  return <Skeleton />
}
```

## Examples

### Rectangle

By default, Skeleton's shape is rectangular. To use this variation, the `shape` property has the `rect` value.

```jsx live
<Skeleton csx={{ size: 128 }} />
```

### Circle

The shape can also be circular. To use this variation, the `shape` property has the `circle` value.

```jsx live
<Skeleton shape="circle" csx={{ size: 100 }} />
```

### Fluid

By default, the `Skeleton` is fluid, which means that both width and height are `100%` of its container.

```jsx live
<Box csx={{ width: 'full', height: 192 }}>
  <Skeleton />
</Box>
```

## Props

| Name  | Type           | Description      | Required | Default |
| ----- | -------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------- |
| csx   | `StyleObject`  | Custom styles    | ðŸš«       | `{}`    |
| shape | `rect, circle` | Skeleton's shape | ðŸš«       | `rect`  |

## Best Practices

1. You should only use `Skeleton` with dynamic elements. This means that, you should not use `Skeleton` if you already have the data information.
