    <summary><h4>When to include a Table or a Card grid?</h4></summary>
    <div>
      More than one layout type can be included in a DataView, but the default layout should be the one that prioritizes the property that best identifies the item. When deciding which layouts to support, follow these recommendations:
      <ul>
        <li>Include a List layout with a Table when there are important item properties that are textual and may need to be compared. For example, a list of products, promotions, or orders.</li>
        <li>Include a Grid layout with Cards when there are important item properties that are visual. For example, app logos in a list of apps or thumbnails in a media gallery.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>What Buttons should be in the DataView header?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    Include tertiary neutral Buttons in the DataView header for actions that are related to the items being shown but don't modify them. For example, <em>Export</em> or <em>Import</em>.
    <br />< br/>
    <strong>What to avoid:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't add primary or secondary actions, such as <em>Create item</em>.</li>
      <li>Don't add actions that are not directly related to the content being shown.</li>
      <li>Don't use Buttons to filter items or to toggle the visibility of filters.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>When to include Search in a DataView?</h4></summary>
  <div>

  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>When to include Pagination in a DataView?</h4></summary>

    </ul>
    <br />

  <summary><h4>What should be the empty state in a Data View?</h4></summary>
  The Data View includes a default 'empty' state for when no items exist in a list. This scenario should be represented by the following characteristics:
  <ul>
    <li>Hide elements that are unnecessary in this state such as the search field, any filters, and both pagination triggers.</li>
    <li>Replace the Table or any other container being used to display the items by the phrase <em>No [entity name] yet</em> and, when it is possible to create items, the <em>Create [entity name]</em> action. This content should be styled and positioned according to the implementation.</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <div>
    <strong>What to avoid:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't use technical language or internal concepts in the empty state message.</li>
      <li>Don't distract users with unnecessary elements or actions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>What should be the no results state in a Data View?</h4></summary>

    <li>Keep the search field, any filters and buttons active and disable both pagination triggers.</li>
    <li>Replace the Table or any other container being used to display the items by the phrase <em>No results found</em> and the <em>Try using different terms or filters</em> instruction. This content should be styled and positioned according to the implementation.</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <div>
    <strong>What to avoid:</strong>
    <ul>

  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>What should be the error state in a Data View?</h4></summary>

    <ul>
        <li>Keep the search field and any filters active and disable both pagination triggers. Disable other buttons if they are unable to be triggered in this state.</li>
        <li>Replace the Table or any other container being used to display the items by the default illustration, the phrase Something went wrong and the Try again action. This content should be styled and positioned according to the implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <div><strong>What to avoid:</strong></div>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't overload the user with too much information or too many options in the error state.</li>
        <li>Avoid making the error state too prominent, as it may be a rare scenario for the user to encounter.</li>
