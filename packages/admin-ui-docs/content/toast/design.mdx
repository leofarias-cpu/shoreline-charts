  <summary><h4>When to use an Alert instead of a Toast?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    Choose an <a href="https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/alert">Alert</a> when the notification loads with the page content and depends on user action to disappear. For example, the <em>Order details</em> page continues to display the Alert with an error in the order until it is solved. Non-dismissive Alerts that indicate progress are the only ones that can appear after the page loads.
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>When to give feedback in a Toast or in the container itself?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    <ul>
        <li>Give (non-contextual) feedback in a Toast when the message is temporary and doesn’t require much attention from the merchant.</li>
        <li>Give (contextual) feedback in the container itself when the message is permanent, very detailed or easier to understand in a contextual position. In these cases, use one of the following options:
            <ul>
                <li>Error text of a form field</li>
                <li>Error or success states</li>
                <li><a href="https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/alert">Alert</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/modal">Modal</a></li>
                <li>Custom progress bar</li>
            </ul></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <strong>What to avoid:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't use Toasts for permanent or detailed messages, as they are not easily discoverable by merchants.</li>
      </ul>
  </div>

<details>
  <summary><h4>When to use an info (default), critical, warning or positive Toast?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Use an info Toast for messages that don't require immediate attention and don't have clear semantics. For example, <em>There are 5 new transactions</em>, with a <em>View new transactions</em> button, when the merchant is viewing a page with outdated information.</li>
      <li>Use a critical Toast when an action fails due to a technical error or a user error, usually with a proposed action. For example, "<em>The font could not be deleted because it's used in styles. Please remove it from styles and try again</em>" with a <em>View styles</em> button.</li>
      <li>Use a warning Toast after a successful action when there is something to be cautious about, usually with a proposed action. For example, <em>The product was saved with 5 issues</em> and a <em>Fix issues</em> button.</li>
      <li>Use a positive Toast to indicate success. If the action takes a while to process, use a positive Toast for the submission itself and an info Alert to indicate progress. For example, <em>Product created successfully</em> in a positive Toast and <em>Product indexing in progress</em> in an info Alert.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details> 

<details>
  <summary><h4>When to include an action on a Toast?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    The Toast message should be as brief as possible, so include an action to complement it when needed. Examples include:
    <ul>
        <li>Providing more details in a modal or related page.</li>
        <li>Retrying a failed action.</li>
        <li>Undoing a successful action.</li>
        <li>Focusing on the first error in a form with issues.</li>
        <li>Refreshing outdated information in the page.</li>
    </ul>
    Read the <a href="https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/button">Button</a> documentation for more details.
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>When should a Toast be dismissible?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    Always. For non-dismissible notifications, use an <a href="https://admin-ui.vercel.app/components/alert">Alert</a> instead.

<details>
  <summary><h4>What should be the position of a Toast in a Page?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    Considering left-to-right interfaces, the Toast should pop from the bottom of the screen and rest on the lower right-hand corner. This is the default behavior and it should not be customized.
  </div>
</details>

  title={tabToc.designReference[3].value}

<details>
  <summary><h4>When should a Toast appear?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    A Toast should appear immediately after the action is triggered (merchant clicks on <em>Save</em>) or the loading feedback is over (loading Button stops spinning).
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>What should be the duration of a Toast?</h4></summary>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Temporary Toasts should take between 5 and 10 seconds, following an average of 3.5 milliseconds per character.</li>
            <li>Permanent Toasts should only be used when the message requires the merchant’s attention or when they are not expecting it. This includes:
                <ul>
                <li>Error Toasts.</li>
                <li>Warning Toasts.</li>
                <li>Toasts that aren’t immediate results of a merchant’s action.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>When should a Toast appear?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    Avoid displaying more than one Toast at the same time. Prefer to summarize the result of an action in a single Toast. For example, use <em>34 products successfully saved</em> when multiple products are edited simultaneously in a bulk action.
  </div>

<details>
  <summary><h4>What should be the message of a Toast?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Write a single sentence that is direct and has up to 2 lines.</li>
      <li>Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.</li>
      <li>Critical Toasts should include an action that fixes the issue or at least explain what to do next.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <strong>What to avoid:</strong>
    <br /><br />
    <ul>
      <li>Don't write text longer than 240 characters. Prefer to include an action that complements the message when needed.</li>
      <li>Don't use personal pronouns.</li>
      <li>Don't use technical language. For example, prefer using <em>The invoice could not be sent because of a technical issue</em> instead of <em>Error 298dx9283 prevented the invoice from being sent</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>What should be the icon of a Toast?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    Each Toast variant includes a specific icon according to its semantics. This is the default behavior and should not be customized.
  </div>
</details>
