  <summary><h4>When to display instructions in an overlay, in the Page itself or in an external link?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose overlays (such as a Modal, a Tooltip or a Popover) for components that don't support inline instructions, such as the label in a Table column or the label of a Totalizer.</li>
        <li>Also choose overlays for information that is important to understand the interface and can't be reduced, such as to explain how the data of a graph is collected.</li>
        <li>Choose to add content in the Page itself (in a description or help text) when the instruction is short and doesn't affect the flow of the page. Consider that the instructions must follow each component's Content guidelines.</li>
        <li>Choose an external link for extensive information that isn't essential for the flow of the page, such as to provide more details on a new concept or step-by-step instructions. For example, documentation explaining the concept of Core web vitals.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<details>
  <summary><h4>When to use a Popover or a Modal instead of a Tooltip?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose a Popover when the instruction includes text longer than 240 characters or elements that have interaction, such as a Button or a Link.</li>
        <li>Choose a Modal when the instruction requires full attention or is part of a Modal flow. For example, a confirmation modal or an onboarding Modal.</li>
    </ul>

  <summary><h4>When to use the default Tooltip trigger or a custom trigger?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    <ul>
        <li>In most cases, you should use the default Tooltip trigger with the question mark because it is known for representing instructions in the Admin.</li>
        <li>When information is truncated according to the content guidelines of a component, a custom trigger can be used to expand it contextually.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <strong>What to avoid:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't use a Tooltip to show the label of a Button with only an icon.</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>Where should the Tooltip open?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    <ul>
        <li>The Tooltip opens on top of the trigger by default, but its placement is automatically adjusted according to the available space. </li>
        <li>Adjust the preferred placement of the Tooltip so it doesn't hide important content around it.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>Where should a Tooltip trigger be positioned?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    On left-to-right interfaces, it should be positioned on the right of a label or title.
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <strong>What to avoid:</strong>
    <br /><br />
    Don't position a Tooltip next to an element that isn't a descriptive Text. For example, don't place it on the right side of a Text Input. Place it next to its label instead.

<details>
  <summary><h4>When should a Tooltip open?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    A Tooltip should always open on hover. If the content includes elements that have interaction, use a Popover that opens on click instead.

<details>
  <summary><h4>What should be the content of a Tooltip?</h4></summary>
  <div>
    <ul>
        <li>Write the Tooltip text as if you are answering the following question: <em>What does this mean?</em>
        <br />
        For example, for a <em>Sessions</em> Totalizer, the Tooltip text can be <em>Visits to the store that can include a series of user interactions and end after 30 minutes of inactivity</em>.</li>
        <li>Start with a noun followed by additional information, such as conditions and definitions.</li>
        <li>Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.</li>
        <li>Prefer using a single sentence that is short and direct.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <strong>What to avoid:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't write text longer than 240 characters.</li>
        <li>Don't repeat the label.</li>
        <li>Don't explain the benefits of the content, only its meaning.</li>
        <li>Don't use periods.</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
