## Best Practices

<OrderedList>
  <OrderedListItem>
    Mind the order of the options, like putting the more probable one to be
    selected at the top. In doubt, sort them alphanumerically (from A to Z and
    from 0 to 9).
  </OrderedListItem>
  <OrderedListItem>
    If there are less than four options listed, consider using a radio button.
  </OrderedListItem>
  <OrderedListItem>
    Don't offer overlapping options, they should be clearly mutually exclusive.
  </OrderedListItem>
</OrderedList>
