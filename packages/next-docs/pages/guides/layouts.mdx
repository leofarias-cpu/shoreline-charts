# Introduction

Shoreline offers a suite of components designed to make structuring web applications pages easy and consistent. The layout components use a uniform spacing system and abstract common web layout patterns, such as stacking content vertically or horizontally or organizing content into a grid.

You can learn more about how to leverage our layout components by visiting the [Layout components section on the components page](TODO) and reading the [spacing system documentation](https://shoreline.vtex.com/foundations/spacing/tokens).
