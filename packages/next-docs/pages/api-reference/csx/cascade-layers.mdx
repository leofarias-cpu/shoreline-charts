# Cascade Layers

Rules within a cascade layer cascade together, giving more control over the cascade to web developers. Any styles not in a layer are gathered together and placed into a single anonymous layer that comes after all the declared layers, named and anonymous. This means that any styles declared outside of a layer will override styles declared in a layer, regardless of specificity.
