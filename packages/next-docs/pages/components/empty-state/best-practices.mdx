# Best Practices

## Properties

### Size

| Value | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| `small` | Inside Cards, Dropdowns, Popovers, and small Modals |
| `medium` | Inside a medium and large Modal |
| `large` | Inside a Collection |

### Title

- Always include a title.
- Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.
- Write at most one line in a direct language.
- Don't use a marketing tone of voice. Prefer to design a custom introduction page.
- Don't use question marks or periods.
- Don’t customize the title style.

### Illustration

- Consider including an illustration to communicate the state quickly and in a pleasant manner.
- The illustration should be simple and easy to understand. Avoid complex illustrations.
- When adding a custom illustration, review existing ones to follow the same stroke style, considering the size of the illustration.
- Don't add shadows and gradients to the illustration.
- Don't modify the size of the illustration.

### Description

- Include a description only if it is necessary to add more details about the state.
- Write a short and direct description that starts with an imperative verb. For example, View, Approve, or Create.
- Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.
- Don’t include links, periods or question marks.

### Actions

Add one or two Buttons if it is necessary to provide next steps. For example, *Create item, Try again*, and *View documentation*.

Read the Button component documentation for more information.

### Background

Use the background of the content that the EmptyState replaced, either `bg-base` or `bg-muted`. 

## Position

- **Position in a container:** Centralized, occupying the exact space of the content it replaced and respecting the container margins. Use the Collection component to correctly position the EmptyState when it is replacing a list.
- I**llustration:** Above the title and center-aligned. Don’t customize this behavior.
- **Description:** Below the title and center-aligned. Don’t customize this behavior.
- **Actions:** Below the description, if it exists, or below the title. List them horizontally when the EmptyState is `large` or `medium` and vertically when `small`. Don’t customize this behavior.
