# Best Practices

## Properties

### Label

- Write a label with at most two words that describes the content of the view.
- Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.
- Don't write labels that vary a lot in length between options.
- Don't use personal pronouns. For example, use *Application keys* instead of *My application keys*.
- Don't include redundant words. For example, use only *Products* and *Categories* instead of *Product permissions* and *Category permissions*.

### Icon

Don't use icons in a Tab, even when combined with a label.

## Position

- **Position in a container:** Considering left-to-right interfaces, Tabs should be in the header of a container, below the title and above the content that can be alternated, always left-aligned. Don’t use Tabs inside a page that already uses Tabs.
- **Order of tabs:** From general to specific, from most to least frequently used, or alphabetically.

## Behavior

### Default selection

Always preselect the first Tab, to avoid confusion and simplify the flow when going through all Tabs.

### Switching tabs

Don't reload the page when switching between tabs.

### Disabled state

Never disable a Tab. Don’t use Tabs to indicate progress.
