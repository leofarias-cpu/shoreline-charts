- If a process takes more than 5s, it's recommended to include the option to cancel the task and also the option to leave the page without interrupting the process.
- When it's not possible to design and implement a custom loading state, use a Spinner and include a short text below it or to its right explaining what is happening.
- Donâ€™t show any loading feedback for processes that take less than 1s.
