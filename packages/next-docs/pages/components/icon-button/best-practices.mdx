# Best Practices

## Properties

### Variant

| Value | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `primary` | Only one at a time, for the most frequently triggered action in a container. |
| `secondary` | Occasionally triggered actions. |
| `tertiary` | Actions that are rarely triggered actions or that exist multiple times in a Page. |
| `critical` or `criticalTertiary` | Irreversible actions. Prefer to keep actions reversible and not use this. |

### Size

| Value | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `large` | Header or footer of Page and Modal. |
| `normal` | Most scenarios. |

### Icon

- Choose an icon that is easily recognizable by itself. For example, the Close, Forward, and Back icons.
- Don’t leave an IconButton without an alternative label. Always add one in the `aria-label` prop.
- If there's no easily recognizable icon, prefer to position the action inside a Menu. Don’t use a Tooltip to display the label.

## Position

Considering left-to-right interfaces:

- **Position in a container:** In most scenarios, list actions horizontally, right aligned and vertically centered. In a form, left-align actions that modify content and right-align those that submit.
- **Order of actions in a list:** In a horizontal list, order from `tertiary` to `primary`. In a vertical list, from `primary` to `tertiary`.
- **Pairing a secondary action with other actions:** Use a `secondary` action alone, next to one `primary` action, or next to one or more `tertiary` actions. Don't include more than one `secondary` action in a group.
- **Pairing a tertiary action with other content:** Use the Bleed component to ignore the box of a `tertiary` or `tertiaryCritical` action and align it based on its icon and/or label.

## Behavior

### Disabled state

- Use a disabled action only if it becomes enabled in some condition. For example, a *Save* action that is only enabled when edits have been made.
- When the reason why an action is disabled might be unclear, leave the action enabled and show a modal explaining it when triggered.
- Don't display a Tooltip when hovering a disabled action.

### Loading state

- Use only for actions that usually take more than 1s and less than 5s to process.
- Don't show loading or progress indicators for actions that take less than 1s to process.
- If the action takes more than 5s to process, display progress feedback in an overlay.

### Confirmation modal

- Display a ConfirmationModal when the action is irreversible. For example, a *Delete* action where it isn't possible to restore the item from the trash.
- Display a ConfirmationModal when the action takes considerable time to undo. For example, a *Publish* action that takes time and can’t be canceled while in progress.
