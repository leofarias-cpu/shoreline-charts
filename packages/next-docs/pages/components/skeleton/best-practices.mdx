# Best Practices

## Properties

### Shape

| Value | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `rect` | Buttons, Text |
| `circle` | Tags, Avatars |

## Position

Position Skeletons so they resemble the content that will load or represent a common scenario for content that is dynamic. For example, to represent text use a set of `rect` Skeletons with a height equal to the line-height of the Text that will load. Don't use large and generic Skeletons.

## Behavior

### Duration

- Display Skeletons during the initial loading of the container and remove it once it ends. Never show a Skeleton after a container has already loaded.
- Don't show a loading state for requests that take less than one second.
- When the container takes longer than 5s to load, prefer to design a custom loading state instead of using a Skeleton.

### Animation

Skeletons have a default pulse animation that is played in a loop. Don't customize this animation.

### Hiding content during loading

- **Only dynamic content:** Skeletons only replace content that needs to load through requests. For example, the label of a piece of information should remain visible during loading.
- **Actions:** Don't replace actions with Skeletons. Use the disabled state of the component if the action can't be triggered during loading.
- **Components with loading states:** Consider that some components already have a loading state that shouldn't be customized, such as the Skeletons in Table columns.
