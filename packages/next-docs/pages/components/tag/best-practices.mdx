# Best Practices

## Properties

### Variant

| Value | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| `primary` | Value is related to the main job and it's crucial for merchants to take immediate action such as changing sales strategies or fixing security issues. |
| `secondary` | Value is not related to the main job. For example, when accessing that products page the merchant may not be interested in the product status. |

### Color

| Value | Usage | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `gray` | Value can't be classified or requires less attention. | Archived |
| `blue` | Value contains information about the system and doesn't require the merchant to act. | Indexing |
| `red` | Value contains negative information and/or require action. | Error or Canceled |
| `orange` | Value requires action and is not related to an error. | Draft |
| `green` | Value contains positive information, such as the status of an item that is matching or surpassing expectations. | Active |
| `cyan`, `teal`, `purple`, or `pink` | Value doesn't have a clear semantic but should be easy to quickly identify and visually differentiate. | App categories |

### Size

| Size | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| `normal` | Next to text using $text-body, $title-display3, or $title-display4. |
| `large` | Next to text using $title-display1 or $title-display2. |

### Label

- Write as short and direct of a label as possible. For example, write *Pending payment* instead of *Waiting for payment*. Don't write text longer than 30 characters.
- Don't use punctuation or separators. For example, write only *Active* instead of *Status: active*.
- Write a property, such as *Active*, or a category, such as *Product page*.
- Use sentence case.

## Position

Considering left-to-right interfaces:

- **Position in a container:** Prefer to position the Tag next to a title or label. Don't position it on the top-right of a container.
- **Position in a table:** Position a column with Tags as one of the last columns, such as immediately before the column with Menu triggers.
- **Position in a header:** Position the Tag on the right side of the title and left-aligned.
- **Space around a tag and between tags:** Consider a safe space around Tags of at least `$space-3` horizontally and `$space-2` vertically. Separate multiple Tags with `$space-3` in horizontal lists and `$space-2` in vertical lists.

## Behavior

### Hover or Click

Tags shouldn't be clickable, removable, or editable. Nothing should happen on hover or click.
