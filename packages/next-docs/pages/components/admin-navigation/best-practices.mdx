# Best Practices

## Content

## Section

- Contact the Admin team to create a new section. A section should only be created if the new pages don't fit the scope of any existing sections.

  <summary>**Definition of current sections**</summary>

  Reach out to the responsible teams for more information about Section scope.
    - **Dashboards:** Analyze data of unified commerce and take informed decisions.
    - **Orders:** Manage several aspects of the orders, such as items, status, transactions, and subscription information.
    - **Catalog:** Manage the assortment of ecommerce products to be sold in their store, set up their capabilities, such as their categories, brands, and collections, define their price strategies, and control item supply.
    - **Promotions:** Define discounts offered to customers based on specific criteria and define additional percentage added to the price of a product.
    - **Storefront:** Define the user experience in their website, including publishing content to the storefront and defining the store search.
    - **Shipping:** Manage logistics such as its strategy, shipping and delivery rates, and pickup points.
    - **Marketplace:** Manage the operations related to their store as a marketplace or the connections with their store with external marketplaces.
    - **Apps:** Install and manage extensions to enhance their store experience or operations.
    - **Store settings:** Set up configurations applied to their store, storefront and how end customers interact with their ecommerce.
    - **User settings (Profile menu):** Set up configurations applied to their user account.
    - **Account settings (Profile menu):** Set up configurations applied to their store’s account.

- Don’t create a section to promote or highlight a product. Sections should improve how most merchants navigate the Admin.
- Don’t add too many pages to a section. Limit sections to 10 pages, to avoid creating scroll and making it difficult to navigate.

#### Name

- Use a noun in title case that describes the pages inside and is commonly used by merchants. For example, a section called *Catalog*.
- Write a maximum of 16 characters in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. In other languages, follow the recommendations of the Localization team.
- Don't use redundant words. For example, the section that includes the *Products* page is called *Catalog*.
- Don’t use internal jargon or marketing names. For example, use *Search* instead of *VTEX Intelligent Search*.
- Don’t use abbreviations. For example, use *Orders* instead of *OMS*.
- Don’t use punctuation or personal pronouns.

#### Icon

- Choose a section icon that represents the name and is easily recognizable by merchants.

### Subsection

- Create a Subsection within a Section only as a last resource to group pages related to a specific topic. For example, the *Search* subsection groups *Relevance Rules* and *Synonyms* within the *Storefront* Section.
- Don’t create a Subsection to promote or highlight a product. Subsections should improve how most merchants navigate the Admin.
- Reach out to the responsible teams to understand the scope of each Subsection.

#### Name

- Use a noun in title case that describes the pages inside and is commonly used by merchants. For example, a Subsection called *Search*.
- Write a maximum of 30 characters for Subsections in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. In other languages, follow the recommendations of the Localization team.
- Don't use redundant words. For example, *Sellers* is the Subsection that includes the *Received SKUs* page.
- Don’t use internal jargon or marketing names. For example, use *Search* instead of *VTEX Intelligent Search*.
- Don’t use abbreviations.
- Don’t use punctuation or personal pronouns.

### Page

- A Page should contain a single primary job. For example, everything related to managing discounts is accessed through the *Promotions* page, and everything related to managing additional charges is accessed through the *Taxes* page.
- When the same content is used for different primary jobs, include shortcuts between pages or tabs so the productivity of a single person conducting multiple jobs isn't harmed. For example, allow the user to create a category through the product creation form, even though the *Products* page is separate from the *Categories* page.
- Don’t define primary jobs with a scope that is not common. For example, a CRUD (*Create, Read, Update, Delete*) operation usually includes creating, listing, editing, and deleting.
- Don’t create separate pages for multiple ways of performing the same action. For example, *Export* and *Import* should be on the same page as *Edit* and *Create*.

**Native Pages**

- Don’t create separate pages for objects related to the same primary job. For example, the *Shipping Strategy* page has *Policies*, *Loading Docks*, and *Warehouses* tabs.
- Add a Page in the navigation only when it doesn't fit the scope of any existing primary job. For example, it makes sense in the CMS to separate pages for managing content, media, and translation.

**Extension Pages**

- An extension should only have one page. If the extension has multiple flows, include internal navigation such as Tabs.
- The settings of any extension should be defined in its manifesto and should be edited only through the page for managing installed apps.

#### Name

- The name should be used in the page URL, Title meta tag, and in the Admin navigation.

**Native Pages**

- Use nouns in title case that describe the content and are commonly used by merchants. For example, use *Orders* instead of *Purchase Requests*.
- Write a maximum of 20 characters in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. In other languages, follow the recommendations of the Localization team.
- Use a precise title that is self-explanatory and complete on its own. For example, use *Security Findings* instead of *Security Center*.
- Don’t use verbs. For example, use *Available Sellers* instead of *Find Sellers*.
- Don’t use redundant words. For example, avoid repeating the section title and using the words *Management* or *List*.
- Don’t use punctuation or personal pronouns.
- Don't use internal jargon or marketing names. For example, instead of *VTEX Shipping Network*, use *Carriers*.
- Add a *(Beta)* suffix if a new page being tested and it coexists with the page that is currently in general availability.
- Add a (Legacy) suffix if a page is from the legacy system, isn't being evolved and there is already a new page for the same purpose in general availability.

**Extension Pages**

- Its title should be the extension name.

## Behavior

### Validating permission

- When the merchant doesn't have permission to access a page, it continues to appear in the navigation, but leads to a screen that informs them they don't have permission.
- For this behavior to work, the LMProductID property must be defined in the navigation.json file that defines the Admin page.

### Pages for specific accounts or users

- It's currently not possible for a page to appear only for a specific user.
- Pages in general availability should appear in the navigation for all accounts except those that apply to specific business models or regions.

### Collapsing Sidebar

- Every time the merchant logs in and starts a session in the Admin, the Sidebar starts in an open state. The merchant can toggle between a closed and an open sidebar by pressing the menu icon in the top left corner of the screen.
- Don’t close or open the Sidebar without explicit user action.

### Searching for a page

Any page in the Admin Navigation should appear in the global search with the same name.

## Position

- **Section:** Contact the Admin team to reorder an existing Section or position a new Section.
- **Subsection:** Contact the Admin team to reorder a Subsection or position a new Subsection.
- **Native Page:** Contact the Admin team to reorder a Page or position a new Page.
    - Position pages related to the same content together. For example, *Categories* and *Brands* would be positioned below *Products*.
    - Position a page being tested just below the related page that is currently in general availability, when applicable. For example, *Content (Beta)* should be positioned just below *Site Editor*.
    - Pages within Subsections should be placed at the end of the Section.
- **Extension Page:** When the extension complements a native page, position its page at the end of the Section or Subsection where the native page is located. For example, *A/B Tests* is a page below *Content* in the *Storefront* section. If the extension doesn’t complement a native page, position its page in the *Apps* section.
    - Don’t add a Section or Subsection specifically for an extension.
    - Don’t position the page of an extension between two native pages. For example, don’t place the "Kit Look" extension page between the *Products* and the *Categories* page.
