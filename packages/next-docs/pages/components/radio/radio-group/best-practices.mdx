# Best Practices

## Properties

### Direction

In most scenarios, distribute options in a `column`. Only distribute in a `row` if the option labels don't vary a lot in length and fit in a single line, considering localization.

### Optional

- Mark a RadioGroup as optional when its options may not apply. For example, preferences for notifications can be left unselected if the merchant doesn’t want to receive them. Consider adding a Custom option together with fields to capture the merchant’s needs.
- By default, the term *(optional)* is included next to the label.
- Don’t mark the mandatory fields or include many optional fields in a form.

### RadioGroup label

- Write the name of the object that is being listed. For example, use the label *Fruits* when the options are *Apple*, *Orange*, and *Banana*.
- Visually hide the label of the RadioGroup only when the page or section title already contains the name of the object being listed.
- Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.
- Don't include redundant words. For example, use only *Characteristics* instead of *Product characteristics* in a form page that already includes *Product* in its title.
- Don't use verbs. For example, instead of *Select characteristics*, use only *Characteristics*.
- Don't use interrogations.

### Radio label

- Write a short label that doesn't vary a lot in length between options and corresponds to the value of the Radio. Use the help text or the RadioGroup label to provide additional context when necessary.
- Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.
- Don't use personal pronouns. For example, write Personal email instead of My email.
- Don't include redundant words. For example, use only S, M, and L instead of Size S, Size M, and Size L.

### Help text

- Include when it's necessary to explain the consequences of checking the option.
- Write as if completing the sentence “If you check this option, you or the system…”.
- Start with a verb in the simple present tense. For example, for the option *Fragile* the help text should be *Prints this information on the shipping label.*
- Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.
- Don't write more than one sentence and don't use periods or commas.

### Error text

- Prevent errors whenever possible. When the value of a field is modified, disable other incompatible fields or options automatically.
- Start with an imperative verb. For example, *Check an option* instead of *This field is required.*
- Don't use incomplete sentences. For example, write *Check an option* instead of *Check one*.
- Don't use periods or commas.

## Position

- **Position in a form:** Prefer placing a RadioGroup at the start or end of a form section. However, if the selection affects the state of other fields, place the RadioGroup close to the fields it will affect.
- **Order of options:** Order them by most to least frequently used, simplest to most complex, least to most risky, or in alphabetical order.

## Behavior

### Preselecting

- Check a common or recommended option by default when this can make the user more efficient and when it isn’t important for the choice to be conscious.
- When a recommended option is preselected, add *(Recommended)* to the end of its label so it can still be identified after edits.

### Disabling

- Disable a Radio only if it becomes enabled in some condition. For example, an option that becomes unavailable when another field has an specific value.
- When the reason why the option is disabled might be unclear, include a ContextualHelp next to the label to explain.
