# Best Practices

## Properties

### Color

- When the Spinner is next to text, replaces text, or on a colored background, use a foreground token from the same surface. For example, when on top of `$bg-muted` use `$fg-muted`.
- If the background color is strong (color-8 or higher), the Spinner should be `white`. For example, use a `white` Spinner if the background color is `$blue-8`.

## Position

- **Position in a container:** When it provides immediate feedback after a trigger was pressed, position it as close as possible to the trigger. For example, use the Button loading state.
- **Text explaining a Spinner:** Avoid including text, since a Spinner shouldn't take more than 5s. If it's not possible to design and implement a custom loading state, use a Spinner with a short text below it or to its right explaining what is happening.
- **Size:** Donâ€™t customize the default size of the spinner.

## Behavior

### Timing

- **Less than 1s:** Don't show any loading feedback.
- **Between 1s and 5s:** Use a Spinner to provide feedback.
- **More than 5s:** Prefer to design a custom loading state, instead of using a Spinner.

### Animating

A Spinner has a default spinning circle animation played in a loop that should not be customized.

### Hiding content during loading

- When a process takes more than 2s and less than 5s, content that might be modified should be completely hidden and temporarily replaced with loading feedback, such as a Spinner.
- When search results are loading, the loading state of the Search should be the only feedback. Maintain the previous results visible in the list until the new ones finish loading.
