# Best Practices

## Properties

### Title

- Start with a verb in the infinitive and then an object. For example, *Delete shipping policy*. When possible, reuse the verb in the label of the action that triggered the modal.
- Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.
- Don't use punctuation, more than three words, or personal pronouns.

### Message

- Write a brief and direct message that informs the consequences of the action and asks the user for confirmation. For example, for a *Delete product* modal the message can be “*This action is irreversible. Are you sure you want to delete this product?”*.
- Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.
- Don't use personal pronouns.

### Actions

- Below the message there should always be a `secondary` *Cancel* Button on the left that closes the modal and a primary Button on the right that confirms the action. Don't add any other action in the modal.
- Use the verb in the modal title as the label for the button that confirms the action.

## Behavior

### Triggering

Actions that have consequences that are irreversible or that are hard to revert should open a ConfirmationModal when triggered. The modal should never open or close automatically.
