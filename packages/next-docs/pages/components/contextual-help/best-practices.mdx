# Best Practices

## Properties

### Content

- The content inside the popover should answer the question “*What does this mean?”.* For example, a trigger next to a *Sessions* label can include the message *Visits to the store which can include a series of user interactions and end after 30 minutes of inactivity*.
- Start with a noun followed by additional information, such as conditions and definitions.
- Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.
- Don't explain the benefits of the content, only its meaning.
- When more information is needed, add a Button below the message that redirects to external documentation. Read the Button documentation for more details.

### Trigger

The default button with a question mark represents instructions and should not be customized.

## Position

- **Trigger position:** On left-to-right interfaces, position it to the right of a label or title.
- **Popover position:** By default, it opens below the trigger, left-aligned, and it's repositioned automatically according to the available space. Use the `placement` prop when necessary to adjust the preferred position so it won't hide important content around it.

## Behavior

### Triggering

The popover opens on click and this behavior should not be customized.
