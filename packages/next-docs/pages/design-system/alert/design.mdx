### When to use a Toast instead of an Alert?

Choose a Toast for notifications related to the entire page that happen
after the page loads and can disappear automatically. Non-dismissive Alerts
that indicate progress are the only ones that can appear after the page
loads.

### When to use info, critical, warning or positive Alert?

- Use an info Alert for neutral notifications that don't require
  attention, such as announcements, product invitations, or task progress.
  For example, "This release is being published and may take up to 5 minutes".

- Use a critical Alert, usually with a proposed action, when an action has
  failed due to a technical error or a user error. For example, "There are 2 invoices that could not be processed because of a
  technical issue" with a _Try again_ button.

- Use a warning Alert when something may not be working as expected or
  when there is something to be cautious about, usually with a proposed
  action. For example, "Stores in this account still can't sell to the final customer" with an _Activate account_ button.

- Use a positive Toast for successful actions or messages that don't
  require attention and further actions. For example, "The performance of this seller improved and now meets minimum
  requirements" with a _View performance_ button.

### When to include an action in an Alert?

The Alert message should be as brief as possible, so include an action to
complement it when needed. Examples include:

- Providing more details in a modal or related page.
- Retrying a failed action.
- Testing a new feature or product

Read the [Button](/components/button) documentation for more details.

### When should an Alert be dismissible?

- Most Alerts should be dismissible, such as success feedback and product
  invitations. Alerts should only be non-dismissible when they provide
  crucial information and their persistence doesn't negatively affect the
  user experience.

- A warning Alert with a help text that needs prominence should be
  considered part of the page's content and therefore non-dismissible. For
  example, "The Application Token will be only displayed once. Make sure to copy and save it in a safe place."

- A critical Alert with an error can be dismissible or not depending on
  its severity. Errors that block the usage of a page should not be
  dismissible. Consider the following examples:
  - Non-dismissible: "This extension is not available, as payment flags are not enabled
    in the store."
    with a _Set up payment_ button.
  - Dismissible:
    "There are 2 invoices that could not be processed because of a
    technical issue."
    with a _Try again_ button.

### What should be the position of an Alert in a container?

Position the Alert semantically, either directly on the page (global Alert)
or inside a card or modal (contextual Alert). Always at the start of the
container, right below its header, taking up 100% of the width and
respecting the container margins.

#### What to avoid

Don't place the Alert inside, above or attached to the Page Header.

### When should an Alert appear?

Alerts should usually appear as the page loads. Non-dismissive alerts that
provides loading feedback, however, can appear right after a merchant's
action.

### What should be the duration of an Alert?

Every Alert should not be dismissed automatically. For temporary
notifications, use a [Toast](/toast) instead.

### When should multiple Alerts appear simultaneously?

Avoid displaying more than one Alert at the same time. Prefer to summarize
the information in a single Alert. For example, use _"There are 10 invoices
with recent updates"_ with a _View details_ button in an _Invoices_ listing
page when there have been multiple updates.

### What should be the message of an Alert?

- Write a single sentence that is direct and has up to 2 lines.
- Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.
- Critical Alerts should include an action that fixes the issue or at
  least explain what to do next.
- An info Alert with a product invitation should use a standard message,
  such as _"A new Products experience is available. This version will be
  discontinued in June 2023."_ with a _Try new version_ button.

#### What to avoid

- Don't write text longer than 240 characters. Prefer to include an action
  that complements the message when needed.
- Don't use personal pronouns.
- Don't use technical language. For example, prefer using _"The invoice
  could not be processed because of a technical issue"_ instead of
  _"Error 298dx9283 prevented the invoice from being processed"_.

### What should be the icon of an Alert?

Each Alert variant includes a specific icon according to its semantics. This
is the default behavior and should not be customized.
