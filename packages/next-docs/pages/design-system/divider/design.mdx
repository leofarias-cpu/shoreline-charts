      When to create sections with a Card or other strategies instead of a
      Divider?
    </h4>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Choose a Card when there is a lot of content, and only white space or
        titles aren't enough to visually differentiate each section. For
        example, the Order details page has a deep hierarchy and needs a Card
        containers to better organize the content.
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose only blank space to differentiate sections when there is enough
        space available and the content is part of the same hierarchy level but
        has a slightly different nature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose a different background to distinguish a small section of content,
        adding a semantic color to draw more attention or a secondary color to
        give less prominence. Be careful, as this option adds weight to the
        interface and can impair contrast.

    <h4>When to use a horizontal or a vertical Divider?</h4>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Choose a horizontal Divider in most cases, to create sections within a
        container.
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose a vertical Divider to create columns when the container has more
        than one scrolling area.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <strong>What to avoid:</strong>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Don’t create content groups with vertical dividers because they
        diversify the reading flow. Each person may end up reading in a
        different order, making it more difficult to guide the experience.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>

  <summary>
    <h4>Where should a Divider be positioned in a container?</h4>
  </summary>
  <div>
    Considering left-to-right interfaces, follow these recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>
        When there is no scroll, a Divider should be positioned respecting the
        margins of the container.
      </li>
      <li>
        When there is a scroll, a Divider should overlap any margins and go to
        the edges of the container.
      </li>
      <li>
        Include a comfortable amount of space before and after the Divider. For
        more details, please refer to the `Spacing` documentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        In specific cases where a Divider is separating items in a list, the
        first and last Divider may be omitted. For example, if the list is
        inside a Card and comes right after the title, the first Divider can be
        omitted. If there is no other grouping after the list, the last Divider
        can also be omitted.
      </li>
    </ul>

  </div>

    <h4>What is the behavior of a section with a Divider during scroll?</h4>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In a container, sections such as the Header and Footer usually remain
        fixed and overlaid on top of the content during scroll to ensure that
        contextual elements, such as an action that advances the flow, remain
        visible at all times.
      </li>
      <li>
        When there is a section separated by a Divider that remains fixed during
        scroll, it is necessary to visually represent that some content is
        hidden after the merchant scrolls. Use the `$shadow.overlay.center`
        token to indicate this depth only after the scroll has started. If the
        merchant returns to the original position and the content is no longer
        hidden, remove the shadow.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <strong>What to avoid:</strong>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Don’t fix large sections to avoid limiting the vertical space available
        for scrolling and making the content consumption experience
        uncomfortable.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>
