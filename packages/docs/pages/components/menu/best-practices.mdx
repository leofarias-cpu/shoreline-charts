# Best Practices

## Properties

### MenuTrigger

#### More actions trigger

- Includes different actions related to the same object, such as the menu for a promotion that includes *Edit*, *Duplicate*, *Deactivate*, and *Archive*.
- It should be triggered by an IconButton with a `IconDotsThreeVertical` icon and a hidden *More actions label*.

Read the IconButton documentation for more information.

#### Custom label trigger

- Represents a single action which has more specific variants, such as a *Create page* menu that includes the options *Landing page* and *Category page*.
- It should be triggered by a Button with a visible label that is followed by an `IconCaretDownSmall` icon.

Read the Button documentation for more information.

### MenuItem

- Use sentence case but capitalize proper nouns.
- Don’t use punctuation, more than three words, or personal pronouns.
- Use a `critical` MenuItem when it triggers an irreversible action. Prefer to keep actions reversible and not require this.

#### More actions trigger

- All the MenuItems should have icons and include a verb in the infinitive in their label.
- When the context already has a label for the object, remove the object from the label. For example, use *Edit* instead of *Edit product*. Leave the object explicit when the Menu has the same action for different objects, such as *Edit product* and *Edit SKUs*.
- Use a verb that reflects the exact action that the Menu Item triggers. For example, use *Rename* instead of *Change name*.
- Reuse existing labels.

#### Custom label trigger

- Don't use verbs or include icons.

### MenuSeparator

Use a divider to separate regular actions from destructive actions. For example, a *Delete* action in a menu should be the last one, and there should be a divider before it.

## Position

- **Position in a container:** Right-align the MenuTrigger and, when it's part of a group of actions, position it as the last action.
- **Pairing a tertiary MenuTrigger with other content:** Use the Bleed component to ignore the box of a `tertiary` action and align it based on its icon and/or label.

## Behavior

### Disabling

- Never disable the MenuTrigger, only disable MenuItems.
- Use a disabled MenuItem only if it becomes enabled in some condition. For example, a *Publish* action that is only enabled when edits have been made.
- When the reason why a MenuItem is disabled might be unclear, leave the action enabled and show a modal explaining it when triggered.
- Don't display a Tooltip when hovering a disabled MenuItem.
