# Best Practices

Spacing tokens are identified in Shoreline by the prefix `$space`. They can be followed by a number suffix that is the space value in rems (or the value in pixels if multiplied by 4), for example the token for a 16px space is `$space-4`, or by the suffix `gap`.

## Usage

Spacing can be applied horizontally or vertically in any CSS property that receives a space value. See below the main scenarios where the tokens are used.

| Token         | Usage         |
| :------------ | :---------- |
| `$space-0`       | **Vertical:** <br/>- `$text-body` texts (Text + Text cell in Table) <br/>- `$text-action` text → $text-body text (Name + Text cell in Table) <br/>- `$text-caption` texts (Help Text and Error Text in fields)     |
| `$space-5`       | **Vertical:** <br/>- `$text-body` text → `$text-caption` text (Label and Help Text in a single Checkbox)     |
| `$space-1`       | **Vertical:** <br/>- Label → Input <br/>- Input → `$text-caption2` text (Help or Error Text) <br/>- Trigger → Popover (Menu, Filter, DatePicker) <br/><br/>**Horizontal:** <br/>- IconButtons `normal` (Admin Shell Topbar, DatePicker input buttons)     |
| `$space-2`       | **Vertical:** <br/>- Buttons `normal` (Empty State small) <br/><br/>**Horizontal:** <br/>- Control → Label (Checkbox, Radio) <br/>- Icon → Short text (Search) <br/>- Normal Actions with a background (Buttons `normal`) <br/>- Large Actions without a background (Tab List)     |
| `$space-3`       | **Vertical:** <br/>- Control Fields Group → `$text-caption2` text (Checkbox Group or Radio Group help text) <br/>- Content paddings top and bottom in narrow containers 120 - 239px <br/>- Content padding-top in Pages without tabs in screens < 380px <br/><br/>**Horizontal:** <br/>- Label → Control Fields (Checkbox Group, Radio Group) <br/>- Icon → Long Text (Toast, Alert) <br/>- Page Title → Tag Large (Page Header) |
| `$space-4`       | - Content paddings in containers 120 - 239px <br/><br/>**Vertical:** <br/>- Controls in a group (Checkbox Group or Radio Group) <br/>- Content padding-top in Pages without tabs in screens 380 - 559px |
| `$space-5`       | **Horizontal:** <br/>- Controls in a group (Checkbox Group or Radio Group) <br/><br/>**Vertical:** <br/>- Fields in a form section <br/>- Content padding-top in Pages without tabs in screens > 560px <br/>- Content paddings top and bottom in narrow containers 240 - 379px |
| `$space-6`       | - Content paddings in containers 240 - 379px <br/><br/>**Vertical:** <br/>- Form section title → Fields <br/>- Content paddings top and bottom in narrow containers 380 - 559px |
| `$space-7`       | - Content paddings in containers 380 - 559px <br/><br/>**Vertical:** <br/>- Content paddings top and bottom in narrow containers 560 - 799px |
| `$space-8`       | - Content paddings in containers 560 - 799px <br/><br/>**Vertical:** <br/>- Content paddings top and bottom in narrow containers 800 - 1600px |
| `$space-10`      | - Content paddings in containers 800 - 1600px <br/><br/>**Vertical and Horizontal:** <br/>- Toast bottom and right margins |
| `$space-12`      | **Vertical:** <br/>- Content padding-bottom in Pages in screens < 560px |
| `$space-16`      | **Vertical:** <br/>- Form sections |
| `$space-20`      | **Vertical:** <br/>- Content padding-bottom in Pages in screens > 560px |

## Application principles

### Relationships and hierarchy

- Elements that are meaningfully related should be closer to each other, for example, a Checkbox and its label.
- Elements arranged in the same spacing pattern are usually perceived as having similar weight, for example, options in a Checkbox Group.
- Spacing can also define the relationships between groups of elements. For example, the space between form sections should have a higher value than the space between the form section title and a field.
- Elements with more spacing around them are usually perceived as having a higher relevance on the interface, for example, the spacing around an error state of a Collection.

### Visual rhythm

- The visual rhythm of an interface is defined by pattern repetition. Spacing helps to create rhythm, improving predictability and scannability. It also allows you to draw the user’s attention to specific points by intentionally breaking the pattern.
- The rhythm can be more predictable when elements within a screen have the same level of importance, such as in a Table.
- The rhythm can also help organize elements that may have different levels of importance, such as in a dashboard.

### Visual weight

- The spacing scale can be applied horizontally or vertically. Depending on the visual weight of the element, sometimes using the same value on both axes doesn't result in a balanced composition. In these scenarios, it's necessary to optically adjust the spacing.
- Observe if the components have a well-defined background (filled or with stroke) or not. For example, the spacing value between primary and secondary Buttons should be larger than the spacing value between two tertiary Buttons.

### Density

- Tighter spacing – more dense – increases the level of scannability for large sets of data, such as in a Table.
- Looser spacing – less dense – increases the level of hierarchy or helps define groups within an interface, such as Form sections.
