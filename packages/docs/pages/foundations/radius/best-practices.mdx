# Best Practices

Radius tokens are identified in Shoreline by the prefixÂ $radius. The prefix is followed by suffixes that are numbers (0, 1, 2, 3) that are agnostic to the token value, they just represent a crescent order. The only exception is the bigger one which the suffix is full. So, the smaller radius token name is $radius-0 and the bigger is $radius-full.

## Usage

The radius used in a component is related to its size and placement.

| Token         | Usage         |
| :------------ | :---------- |
| `$radius-0`       | Page components (Header and Content) and Admin Navigation components (Topbar and Sidebar)     |
| `$radius-1`       | Checkboxes and Buttons inside inputs     |
| `$radius-2`       | Buttons, Inputs, Filters, Alerts, Toasts, Cards, and Popovers     |
| `$radius-3`       | Modals     |
| `$radius-full`       | Tags and Avatars     |
