# Best Practices

Elevation tokens are divided in three types:

- Focus Ring – Identified by the prefix `$focus-ring` followed by a suffix that indicates the the semantic value according to the colors guidelines (`base`, `accent`, or `critical`).
- Shadow – Identified by the prefix `$shadow` followed by suffixes that are numbers that are agnostic to the token value, they just represent a crescent order.
- Z-index – Identified by the prefix `$z` followed by suffixes that are numbers that are agnostic to the token value, they just represent a crescent order.

## Focus Ring

Include focus states for merchants that prefer or require keyboard navigation (a web standard mentioned in the [rationale](https://shoreline.vtex.com/foundations/elevation/rationale)) and to highlight error states on form fields.

| Token         | Usage         |
| :------------ | :---------- |
| `$focus-ring-base`       | Focus ring of form fields, actions in neutral colors (Secondary and Tertiary Buttons, and items in a Menu), and popovers     |
| `$focus-ring-accent`       | Focus ring of actions in accent color (Primary Buttons)     |
| `$focus-ring-critical`       | Focus ring of form fields in error state and actions in critical colors (Critical Buttons and critical items in a Menu)     |

## Shadow

As mentioned in the [rationale](https://shoreline.vtex.com/foundations/elevation/rationale), use shadows to indicate that an element is over another and there is content hidden below it.

| Token         | Usage         |
| :------------ | :---------- |
| `$shadow-1`       | Popovers     |
| `$shadow-2`       | Modal, Drawer, and Toast     |

## Z-index

Z-index is the CSS property that controls the stacking order of elements on a page, measured along the z-axis. A higher z-index value means that an element will appear in front of another with a lower z-index value. Elements in the Admin are stacked as described below.

| Token         | Usage         |
| :------------ | :---------- |
| `$z-1`       | Page Content, Page Header     |
| `$z-2`       | Drawer Backdrop     |
| `$z-3`       | Drawer     |
| `$z-4`       | Modal Backdrop     |
| `$z-5`       | Modal     |
| `$z-6`       | Popover     |
| `$z-7`       | Toast     |
| `$z-8`       | *No scenarios mapped*     |
| `$z-9`       | Tooltip     |
| `$z-10`       | Floating contextual help     |
