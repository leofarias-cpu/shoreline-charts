# Functions

### connect

- Type: `() => void`

```tsx filename="pages/_app.tsx"
import { connect } from '@vtex/raccoon-next'

connect()

// ... rest of the app
```

This function connects the Next.js application with the IO application by listening to message events sent by the Raccoon Iframe on the admin-shell.

### bootstrap

- Type: `(app: ((props: Next.AppProps) => React.ReactNode)) => React.ReactNode`

```tsx filename="pages/_app.tsx"
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'
import { bootstrap } from '@vtex/raccoon-next'

function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default bootstrap(App)
```

The bootstrap function is responsible for displaying the `SplashScreen` component, which indicates when it's not possible to load the Next.js application. For example, if the page fails to retrieve the token (`VtexIdclientAutCookie`) information, a retry screen is shown. Additionally, if you attempt to access the Next app outside of VTEX Admin, a screen will be displayed indicating that it's not possible.
