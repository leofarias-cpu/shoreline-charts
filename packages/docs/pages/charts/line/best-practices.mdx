# Best practices

## Sizing

- Line charts have a minimum widht and height of 300x200px and in general you should follow the 3:2 aspect ratio.

## Labels

- Reuse existing labels.
- Avoid using oversized labels, try to keep the size the one suggested in the component or break it into 2 lines.
- Use sentence case but capitalize proper nouns.
- Don’t use punctuation or more than two words.
- Abbreviate only when the meaning is clear (Ex: “Mon” for Monday).
- Numbers can be abbreviated using letters. Use capital letters.
  - 100.000 = 100K
  - 1.000.000 = 1M
  - 1.000.000.000 = 1B

## Position

- In general, position the chart inside a Card component.
- When not inside a Card component, in most cases it should be left aligned inside the container it's positioned into.
