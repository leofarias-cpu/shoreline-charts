# Best Practices

## Sizing
- Area charts have a minimum widht and height of 300x200px and in general you should follow the 3:2 aspect ratio.

## Labels
- Avoid using oversized labels, if necessary break them into two lines.
- Don’t use punctuation or more than two words.
- Abbreviate only when the meaning is clear (Ex: “Mon” for Monday).
- Numbers can be abbreviated using letters. Use capital letters. Check "bar chart with big numbers" example.
    - 100.000 = 100K
    - 1.000.000 = 1M
    - 1.000.000.000 = 1B
