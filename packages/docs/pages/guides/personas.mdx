# Personas

Personas are a way to represent the different types of Shoreline users and define how they interact with the project.
We divided them into two categories: **Maintainer** and **Contributor**.

## Maintainer

A maintainer is a user with a deep knowledge of the project. They are the ones who have the final word, and are
responsible for guiding the discussions, making decisions, and ensuring the project is on the right track. Besides that,
they will define the project's roadmap, and should be able to communicate the project's goals and vision to the community.

Even though, it doesn't mean that the maintainers will be the only ones contributing to the project. They should encourage
contributions from the community and help them to understand how they can contribute.

In summary, those are maintainers responsibilities:

1. Define the project's roadmap
2. Communicate the project's goals and vision
3. Guide the discussions
4. Make decisions
5. Ensure the project is on the right track
6. Encourage contributions from the community
7. Help the community to understand how they can contribute
8. Review and merge pull requests
9. Spread project knowledge with contributors

## Contributor

The contributor represents the project user that wants to contribute to the project. They can contribute in many ways, such as
reporting bugs, proposing new features, fixing bugs, writing documentation, and more.

In summary, those are contributors responsibilities:

1. Report bugs
2. Propose new features
3. Fix bugs
4. Write documentation
5. Review pull requests
6. Help other contributors
7. Being active in the project discussions
