# Introduction

In this section you will learn how to contribute to Shoreline.

We encourage everyone to contribute to the project, regardless of their experience level or discipline.
We welcome everything from documentation improvements and bug fixes to new features and architectural changes.

## How to get involved

You can get involved in two ways:

**Participation**

Being proactive on the project discussions is a great way to start contributing and getting context about the project. You can do it in many ways:

* Propose a solution in an open issue
* Open an issue with a proposal
* Report a bug and how to fix it
* Open a discussion related to the project
* Participate on discussions that weren't open by you

Check out the [Processes section](/guides/processes) to understand how it works.

**Hands-on**

Although most of the contributions are made through Github, the changes can also be applied to our Figma library.
It doesn't matter if you are a designer or a engineer, you can contribute in both paths.

* Check out the [Engineering contribution section](/guides/engineering-contribution/development-guideline) if you want to make changes to the codebase.
* Check out the [Design contribution section](/guides/design-contribution/handoff-requirements) if you want to make changes to the Figma library.

## Contribution types

The contributions are groupped into three categories:

**Light**: A simple change to the project that doesn't require much effort

* Report a bug
* Open a discussion related to the project
* Give feedbacks
* Share your thoughts in discussions that weren't open by you.
* Learn about the project
* A small design or documentation tweak to an existing feature

**Medium**: A bigger change to the project that requires more effort

* Bug fixes
* Improvements on documentation
* Components styling changes
* New features that don't involve complex changes

**Heavy**: Involves complex changes to the project

* Implement a new component API
* Architectural changes
* Implement a new feature that involves complex changes

## Shoreline backlog

We have a backlog with all the issues that are ready to be worked on. By ready, we mean that the issue was already discussed, it has a proposed solution and it approved by
the maintainer. Thoses issues are tagged with the label `status: active`.

Feel free to reach out to the maintainers through the Github issue if you want to work on a specific issue.

Keep in mind that when taking a task from the backlog, you are responsible for it. Make sure to communicate with the maintainers if you have any questions or need help.

## Personas

Personas are a way to represent the different types of Shoreline users and define how they interact with the project.
We divided them into two categories: **Maintainer** and **Contributor**.

### Maintainer

A maintainer is a user with a deep knowledge of the project. They are the ones who have the final word, and are
responsible for guiding the discussions, making decisions, and ensuring the project is on the right track. Besides that,
they will define the project's roadmap, and should be able to communicate the project's goals and vision to the community.

Even though, it doesn't mean that the maintainers will be the only ones contributing to the project. They should encourage
contributions from the community and help them to understand how they can contribute.

In summary, those are maintainers responsibilities:

1. Define the project's roadmap
2. Communicate the project's goals and vision
3. Guide the discussions
4. Make decisions
5. Ensure the project is on the right track
6. Encourage contributions from the community
7. Help the community to understand how they can contribute
8. Review and merge pull requests
9. Spread project knowledge with contributors

### Contributor

The contributor represents the project user that wants to contribute to the project. They can contribute in many ways, such as
reporting bugs, proposing new features, fixing bugs, writing documentation, and more.

In summary, those are contributors responsibilities:

1. Report bugs
2. Propose new features
3. Fix bugs
4. Write documentation
5. Review pull requests
6. Help other contributors
7. Being active in the project discussions
