# Component

Understand how to create a Shoreline component, whether it is a new component, propose an improvement, or fix a bug. Only components that follow these guidelines will be allowed to be added to the library.

## Patterns

- When creating a component, understand its web standards. Use [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) as a reference.
- Any color combination must pass the mid-range conformance level for accessibility requirements AA.
- If your component uses another existing one, reuse it. For example, a new component that has a button must use the Shoreline Button.

## Structure

### 1. Tokens usage

- Always use Shoreline [tokens](https://shoreline.vtex.com/foundations) for all spacing, color, typography, and shadow values when building a component.
- We do not recommend using custom values. Always thoroughly test the use of tokens before proposing anything customized.

### 2. Autolayout and constraints

- Apply auto layout and constraints whenever possible, ensuring responsiveness, correct spacing, and scalability in the component's application.
- We do not recommend using Groups in components.

### 3. Height and width

Apply definitions of max/min-height or width whenever they exist. For example, form fields always use 320px, since the mobile width is 360px and has a 20px margin on each side.

### 4. Layers

- Optimize the use of layers as much as possible.
- Look at other components with similar elements to better understand the names already used.
- Name the layer in a way that precisely indicates what it contains, whether it's a single element or a group.
    - Assign a label as the name for icon instances and text layers. For example, a text layer "Search..." is renamed to *Placeholder*.
    - When a layer is a group of other layers, name it with the names of the internal layers using the "+" symbol between the names. For example, the layer containing the icon and the message of the Alert is named Icon + Message, for any variant of the Alert, and contains the layers *[IconName]*, keeping the original name of the icon since each variant uses a specific icon, and *Message*.
    - When an Icon from a component can be replaced with other icons, its layer is named *Icon*.
    - Shapes and vector layers should also follow the same logic. For example, the layer of the arrow shape in the Tooltip is named *Tip*.

### 5. Variants and properties

#### Usage

- Look at other components to better understand the patterns of property names already used.
- Maximize the number of variants and leverage properties (boolean, instance swap, text) to create less complex, high-performance, and easy-to-apply components.
- Some components exist to serve many different scenarios, such as the [Table](https://www.figma.com/file/PWGSQ26U55u8E34JWn9ZYE/Shoreline-%E2%80%93-Components?type=design&node-id=1940-92476&mode=design&t=CnO7eWBhRIJ5RdIQ-4), and it's impractical to create a component that covers 100% of them. Therefore, it's acceptable for some components to need to be detached when applying it. Always consider the acceptable limit of variants that meet the usage needs while keeping the component optimized.
- Include all applicable states. For example, default, hover, pressed, focus, disabled, loading, empty, no results, error loading, error searching, and dragging.
    - Reuse styles from the hover state for the focus state.
    - When there's a focus ring, apply clip content and background color to all variants.
- Expose properties of nested instances whenever possible. Sequentially name nested instances. For example, Row 1, Row 2, and Row 3 in a Table.

#### Naming

- Name a property in a way that directly indicates what is being configured. Do not include verbs. For example, a property for the states of a component will be called state, a property to change the error text will be called *errorText*, and a property to toggle the label of the Input will be called *label*.
- Use camelCase for the names of properties and variants.
- Properties that are used to edit a value, such as text or instance swap, should always have a period (.) at the end. Figma does not allow two properties with the same name, and usually, these value properties coexist with another visibility property of the same element.

#### Prototype

- Connect the component variants in a prototype whenever it makes sense. In general, connect the default state with the hover state and then with the pressed/focus state. Also, include a connection for pressing the ESC key to return to the focus state.
- Avoid creating too many connections in the component, as this can make its application difficult.
- Use transition animation that will be implemented in code, or Instant when in doubt.

## Library organization

### 1. Name and description

- Define the name according to how the component is best known in the market and use TitleCase, without spaces between words.
- Write the description using a maximum of two short sentences, including the component's function and, if necessary, any relevant behavior or property.
- Use [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/), [The Component Gallery](https://component.gallery/components/), [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/), and other well-established design systems as references.

### 2. Component

- The documentation of a component in the [library](https://www.figma.com/file/PWGSQ26U55u8E34JWn9ZYE/Shoreline-%E2%80%93-Components?type=design&t=TS78wGSzUvIRBRKY-6) should always follow the [component section template](https://www.figma.com/file/1rQH2tU85kYEYRHRoAP5gZ/InnerSource-%E2%80%93-Design-Templates?type=design&node-id=23-28325&mode=design&t=5JmOPDBymodF7bUk-4). Follow the instructions included in the template.
- Follow the alphabetical order to organize the sections of the components, including the order of the layers.

![Component sections](/assets/component-sections.png)

- Follow the pattern in organizing the component variants.
    - Position the default variant in the top-left corner.
    - Spacing of at least 20px between variants.
- Component frame with padding of 200px whenever possible, or at least 100px, and without borders.
- Base components (parts of the component that are not used by themselves) should always have the emoji ⚙️ at the beginning of the name.
- Fill in the Component configuration.
    - Include a description of the component, keywords (other names by which the component may be known), and implementation status (for a new component, the status will be *Not implemented yet*).
    - Select the option "Simplify all instances".
    - The link will only be filled in after the component is published on the documentation website.

![Component configuration](/assets/component-configuration.png)

- Order the variants and the values of each variant to follow a logical order.
    - Properties that depend on another boolean property should be below it. For example, the value property of a label is below the boolean property of the label.
    - In the absence of a logical order, follow alphabetical order.

## Documentation

All components must have documentation on the [Shoreline website](https://shoreline.vtex.com/components).

### 1. Related components

Define the related components that appear on the main page of a component by answering the question: *which other components have an application that may generate doubt regarding the new component?* For example, there may be confusion between the application of a Button and an IconButton, so the IconButton is included as a [related component](https://shoreline.vtex.com/components/button#related-components) of the Button.

### 2. Best practices

- Visual components should always have Best practices documentation.
- Look at other components to better understand the patterns.
- Depending on the content, write in bullet points or include it in tables,
- The documentation content should always be part of one of the sections: Properties, Position, and Behavior. Not all components will have all three.
    - In Properties, describe the usage and guidelines for each property of the component. For example, the application scenarios for each variant, how to write a Label, or which icon to use. Each property should be a subsection.
    - In Position, describe where the component should be positioned in a container or how parts of a component should be positioned within it.
    - In Behavior, describe the possible behaviors of the component. For example, when the component is disabled, when it's in a loading state, or when it has scrolling.
