# Test guideline

All Shoreline components are tested by default and we have three types of tests that we use to ensure the quality of our components and library.

## Visual tests

We use [Storybook visual testing](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/visual-testing) to write visual tests.

[Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) is the tool responsible for run the visual regression tests whenever a change is made, by comparing the stable
stories with the new ones. We need to make a responsible use of this tool, so we take snapshots of our
components from a single story containing all possible variations of a component, instead of taking snapshots of every single story.

This is a good practice that helps us keep our Storybook documentation lean and easy to navigate.

## Interactive tests

We use [Storybook play functions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/play-function/) to write interactive tests.

## Unit tests

We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) to write unit tests.

### Where does all Storybook stories go?

We use [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) to power our Storybook documentation and [you can find our storybook here](https://shoreline.storybook.vtex.com).
