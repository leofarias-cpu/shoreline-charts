## Composition

Composition is often useful for easily extending behavior. Shoreline relies on the children's property for this task.
Composable components accept the `asChild` boolean property. When true, the component will not render its default DOM element,
cloning the props to the first child instead.

You can check the [Composition](/guides/composition/introduction) section to understand how it works its usage.

### How to implement it?

You must use the [Compose component](/components/compose) in order to implement composition within Shoreline. This component is responsible for render the
children and pass the props to them.

```tsx
import { Compose } from '@shoreline/components';

export function ComposableButton(props) {
  const { asChild, ...restProps } = props;
  const Composition = asChild ? Compose : 'button';

  return (
    <Composition {...restProps}>
      {children}
    </Composition>
  );
}
```
