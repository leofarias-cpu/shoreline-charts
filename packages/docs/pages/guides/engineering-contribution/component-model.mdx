## Composition

Composition is often useful for easily extending behavior. Shoreline relies on the children's property for this task.
Composable components accept the `asChild` boolean property. When true, the component will not render its default DOM element,
cloning the props to the first child instead.

You can check the [Composition](/guides/composition/introduction) section to understand how it works its usage.

You must use the [Compose component](/components/compose) in order to implement composition within Shoreline. This component is responsible for render the
children and pass the props to them.

```tsx
import { Compose } from '@vtex/shoreline';

export function ComposableButton(props) {
  const { asChild, ...restProps } = props;
  const Composition = asChild ? Compose : 'button';

  return (
    <Composition {...restProps}>
      {children}
    </Composition>
  );
}
```

## Internationalization

We have internal translations to help our users by previously defining common messages and letting them use the messages.
This way, we can ensure that the messages are consistent across the apps.

You must follow 3 steps in order to implement internationalization within Shoreline:

<Steps>

### Messages folder

Create a new folder `messages` under the component folder. This is where you will store the messages for the component.

```json
// messages/en.json file
{
  "admin/search-label": "Search"
}
```

### Use the translations

Use the translations inside the component by importing the `createMessageHook` function.

```tsx
import { createMessageHook } from '@vtex/shoreline'

const useMessage = createMessageHook(messages)

function Search(props) {
  const getMessage = useMessage()

  return <input placeholder={getMessage('admin/search-label')} {...props}/>
}
```

### Setup crowdin

Add the messages folder path to the `crowndin.yml` configuration file located in the root of the project.

```yml
files:
  - source: /packages/shoreline/src/components/YOUR_COMPONENT/messages/en.json
    translation: /%original_path%/%two_letters_code%.%file_extension%
```

</Steps>
