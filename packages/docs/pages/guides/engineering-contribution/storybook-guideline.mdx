# Storybook guideline

Storybook is a key tool for developing components in Shoreline. It allows us to develop components in isolation and test them. Shoreline's Storybook is live at https://shoreline.storybook.vtex.com. This guideline will help you understand the best practices for writing stories for Shoreline components.

Always have the [Storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started) in hand while writing stories.

## Writing stories

Stories are the way we document and test components in Shoreline. Stories are written in `<story-type>.stories.tsx` files, which are located in the `stories` folder of each component.

### Folder structure

This is the expected folder structure for stories in Shoreline, considering each story type:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="components" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="button" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="stories" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="play.stories.tsx" />
        <FileTree.File name="show.sotires.tsx" />
        <FileTree.File name="examples.stories.tsx" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="tests" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="test-case-1.stories.tsx" />
          <FileTree.File name="test-case-2.stories.tsx" />
          <FileTree.File name="test-case-n.stories.tsx" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Exports

Each story file should export the stories according to the story type. For example, a `play.stories.tsx` file should export a `Play` story, a `show.stories.tsx` file should export a `Show` story, and so on, as well as the default export for the story file.

| Story type | Filename                | Expected export                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Play       | play.stories.tsx        | `Play`                                   |
| Show       | show.stories.tsx        | `Show`                                   |
| Examples   | examples.stories.tsx    | `Example1`, `Example2`, `ExampleN`, etc. |
| Tests      | test-case-n.stories.tsx | `Test1`, `Test2`, `TestN`, etc.          |

### Story types

We categorized four story types to help us write stories for Shoreline components, targeting specific goals for each type.

Always use your best judgment to decide which story is applicable to the component you are working on, as not all components will need all types of stories.

All stories, except for the [Show](#show) story, should have the `chromatic` parameter disabled. This is because the [Show](#show) story is the only one that should be visually tested by [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/).

#### Play

An interactive playground that allows viewers to control the values of a set of props. A component has only one Play story. This story is specially useful for testing the permutation of props from a component.

##### Sample structure

Here is an example of a Play story base structure:

```tsx filename="play.stories.tsx"
interface StoryArgs extends ComponentProps {
  // Any additional props
}

export function Play(args: StoryArgs) {
  // Any additional logic, such as state

  return <Component {...args} />;
}
```

##### Story configuration

This is the expected default export for a `play.stories.tsx`, in which `argTypes` and `args` should be defined according to the component's props and passed to the component:

```tsx filename="play.stories.tsx"
export default {
  title: "components/<component-name>",
  argTypes: {
    // Define the props here
  },
  args: {
    // Define the default props here
  },
  parameters: {
    chromatic: { disableSnapshot: true },
  },
};
```

#### Show

A component should only have one Show story. This story is used to show the component in all possible states, variants, and sizes, side by side on a single page. **This is the story which visual tests run in Chromatic**.

When writing the Show story, you should consider the following (if applicable):

- The story should show the component in all possible states.
- The story should show the component in all possible variants.
- The story should show the component in all possible sizes.

##### Sample structure

Here is an example of a Show story base structure:

```tsx filename="show.stories.tsx"
export function Show() {
  // Render the component in all possible states, variants, and sizes
}
```

##### Story configuration

This is the expected default export for a `show.stories.tsx`, note that **this is the only story that shouldn't have Chromatic's snapshot disabled (if possible, for the aforementioned reasons)**:

```tsx filename="show.stories.tsx"
export default {
  title: "components/<component-name>",
};
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Not all components will be able to have visual tests**. For example,
  components that are pop-overs, modals, or any other component that requires
  user interaction to be displayed is not caught by visual tests. Nonetheless,
  you should still write Show stories for these components.
</Callout>

#### Examples

A component may have multiple Example stories. These stories are used to show the component in a real-world scenario, often interacting with other components or even libraries, and have examples that aren't reproduced by the Play and Show stories.

When writing Example stories, you should consider the following (if applicable):

- The story should show the component in a real-world scenario, often interacting with other components or even libraries.
- The story should have examples that aren't reproduced by the Play and Show stories, such as the application of Composition, State Management, or other patterns that doesn't change the UI.

##### Sample structure

Here is an example of an Example story base structure:

```tsx filename="examples.stories.tsx"
export function AsX() {
  // ...
}

export function Controlled() {
  // ...
}

export function Uncontrolled() {
  // ...
}
```

##### Story configuration

This is the expected default export for a `examples.stories.tsx`. Note that the `chromatic` parameter is disabled for this story type, as it's not meant to be visual tested by Chromatic:

```tsx filename="examples.stories.tsx"
export default {
  title: "components/<component-name>",
  parameters: {
    chromatic: { disableSnapshot: true },
  },
};
```

<Callout type="info">
  You might want to break down the examples into multiple stories if they are
  too complex, or if the file becomes too large (300+ lines).
</Callout>

#### Tests

Represents an interaction test case. These are run using the storybook-test-runner. A component may have multiple Test stories.

When writing Test stories, you should consider the following (if applicable):

- The story should test component interactions, such as user input, focus, click and other events.

<Callout type="info">
  All stories are render-tested by default, meaning that you don't need to write
  tests to check whether or not a component will render.
</Callout>

##### Sample structure

Here is an example of a Test story base structure:

```tsx filename="tests/do-something.stories.tsx"
export function DoSomething() {
  // Code to test component interactions
}
```

##### Story configuration

This is the expected default export for a `tests/<test-case-n>.stories.tsx`. Note that the `chromatic` parameter is disabled for this story type, as it's not meant to be visual tested by Chromatic:

```tsx filename="tests/do-something.stories.tsx"
export default {
  title: "components/<component-name>/tests",
  play: async ({ canvasElement }: { canvasElement: HTMLElement }) => {
    // Interaction test code to "do something", here
  },
  parameters: {
    chromatic: { disableSnapshot: true },
  },
};
```
