# Component model

In this section you can find detailed information about how to handle components specifities such as state, styling, composition and internationalization.

## State

All Shoreline components are [Controlled](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#controlled-and-uncontrolled-components). This means that they are responsible for managing their own state and exposing
it to the parent component. This way, the parent component can control the state if necessary.

You can check the [State Management section](/guides/state-management) to understand how it works and how to use it.

## Styling

The way we style component in Shoreline is equal the way we recommend our users to style their components. The only difference is that
we use use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to apply css. The theme and the styles are defined within the `shoreline` package, [you can check it here](https://github.com/vtex/shoreline/tree/main/packages/shoreline/src/themes/sunrise)

Go for the [Styling section](/guides/styling/introduction) to get a detailed information and understand how styling works in Shoreline.

## Composition

Composition is often useful for easily extending behavior. Shoreline relies on the children's property for this task.
Composable components accept the `asChild` boolean property. When true, the component will not render its default DOM element,
cloning the props to the first child instead.

You can check the [Composition section](/guides/composition/introduction) to understand how it works and how to use it.

You must use the [Compose component](/components/compose) in order to implement composition within Shoreline. This component is responsible for render the
children and pass the props to them.

```tsx
import { Compose } from '@vtex/shoreline';

export function ComposableButton(props) {
  const { asChild, ...restProps } = props;
  const Composition = asChild ? Compose : 'button';

  return (
    <Composition {...restProps}>
      {children}
    </Composition>
  );
}
```

## Internationalization

We have internal translations to help our users by previously defining common messages and letting them use the messages.
This way, we can ensure that the messages are consistent across the apps.

You must follow 3 steps in order to implement internationalization within Shoreline:

<Steps>

### Messages folder

Create a new folder `messages` under the component folder. This is where you will store the messages for the component.

```json
// messages/en.json file
{
  "search-label": "Search"
}
```

### Use the translations

Use the translations inside the component by importing the `createMessageHook` function.

```tsx
import { createMessageHook } from '@vtex/shoreline'

const useMessage = createMessageHook(messages)

function Search(props) {
  const getMessage = useMessage()

  return <input placeholder={getMessage('search-label')} {...props}/>
}
```

### Provide overwriting capability

In most cases, it is necessary to allow the user of the component to override the internal messages.

You do this by adding a property called `messages` and passing as argument to `useMessage`.
The `messages` type must contain the same keys used in your files from `messages` folder.

```tsx
import { createMessageHook } from '@vtex/shoreline'

const useMessage = createMessageHook(messages)

function Search(props) {
  const { messages } = props
  const getMessage = useMessage(messages)

  return <input placeholder={getMessage('search-label')} {...props}/>
}

interface SearchOptions {
  /**
   * Search internal messages
   */
  messages?: SearchMessages
}

export type SearchProps = SearchOptions & ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'input'>

type SearchMessages = {
  'search-label'?: string
}

```


</Steps>
