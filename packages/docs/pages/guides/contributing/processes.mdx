# Processes

Here you can find a detailed description of how each contribution process works.

## Report a bug

Reporting a bug means that you’ve found a potential issue with the library and want
to share it with the community to understand if it’s a valid issue or not.

**Step 1: Open a GitHub issue in the Shoreline repository**
Use the bug report template and answer important questions like what is the 
context, the issue you are facing, and the evidence you have. If you already 
have a potential solution to this issue don’t forget to share it. Don't worry 
if you aren’t sure about the issue! Share it and start a discussion as early 
as possible.

**Step 2: Discussion**
You can get feedback through comments on the GitHub issue. Make sure to share 
all the necessary information about the issue so the community can help to 
understand the problem.  As you make progress, make sure to update your issue.

**Step 3: Definition**
As the discussions and refinements occur, your issue can be classified as valid to
be resolved or not. If it is valid, the issue can have two destinations. 
- **Shoreline backlog:** The issue is in great shape and is good to read, so it can be
moved to the backlog by a maintainer.
- **Summarize in a new issue:** The issue has much information and is necessary 
to rewrite it before moving to the backlog. The maintainer will be responsible 
to it and in the new issue it will add a reference to the original one.

After that, the issue will be tagged with the label status: active which means that it is ready to be resolved.
