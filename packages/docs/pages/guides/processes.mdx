# Processes

You can contribute in several ways, depending on your interest and bandwidth.
Whether you want to volunteer for existing work or just submit an idea or report
a bug, there are processes to follow. Learn about them here.

## Report a bug

Reporting a bug means that you’ve found a potential problem with the library, in
Figma or code, and want to share it with the community or even propose a solution
for it.

**Step 1: Open a GitHub issue in the Shoreline repository**

Use the bug report template and answer important questions like what is the 
context, the issue you are facing, and the evidence you have. If you already 
have a potential solution to this issue don’t forget to share it. Don't worry 
if you aren’t sure about the issue! Share it and start a discussion as early 
as possible.

For bug fixes in Figma, propose a solution by creating a branch in the library
with the name _Fix [Component or Icon name]_.

**Step 2: Discussion**

You can get feedback through comments on the GitHub issue. Make sure to share 
all the necessary information about the issue so the community can help to 
understand the problem. As you make progress, make sure to update your issue.

**Step 3: Definition**

As the discussions and refinements occur, your issue can be classified as valid to
be resolved or not. If it is valid, the issue can have two destinations. 
- **Shoreline backlog:** The issue is in great shape and is good to read, so it can be
moved to the backlog by a maintainer.
- **Summarize in a new issue:** The issue has much information and is necessary 
to rewrite it before moving to the backlog. The maintainer will be responsible 
for it and in the new issue it will add a reference to the original one.
- **Design Handoff:** If you fixed a Figma bug, prepare the handoff following the
guidelines and post the files in the issue. For bugs restricted to Figma, a
maintainer will merge the component or icon branch in the Figma library. For bug
fixes that will need to be implemented, besides merging the branch, the maintainer
will move the issue to the Shoreline Backlog, so that a developer can volunteer
to implement it.



After that, the issue will be tagged with the label status: active which means that it is ready to be resolved.
