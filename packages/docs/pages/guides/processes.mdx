# Processes

You can contribute in several ways, depending on your interest and bandwidth.
Whether you want to volunteer for existing work or just submit an idea or report
a bug, there are processes to follow. Learn about them here.

## Report a bug

Reporting a bug means that you’ve found a potential problem with the library, in
Figma or code, and want to share it with the community or even propose a solution
for it.

![Bug report flow](/assets/bug-report.png)

**Step 1: Open a GitHub issue in the Shoreline repository**

Use the [bug report template](https://github.com/vtex/shoreline/issues/new/choose) and answer important questions like what is the 
context, the issue you are facing, and the evidence you have. If you already 
have a potential solution to this issue don’t forget to share it. Don't worry 
if you aren’t sure about the issue! Share it and start a discussion as early 
as possible.

For bug fixes in Figma, propose a solution by creating a branch in the library
with the name _Fix [Component or Icon name]_.

**Step 2: Discussion**

You can get feedback through comments on the GitHub issue. Make sure to share 
all the necessary information about the issue so the community can help to 
understand the problem. As you make progress, make sure to update your issue.

**Step 3: Definition**

As the discussions and refinements occur, your issue can be classified as valid to
be resolved or not. If it is valid, the issue can have three destinations. 
- **Shoreline backlog:** The issue is in great shape and is good to read, so it can be
moved to the backlog by a maintainer.
- **Summarize in a new issue:** The issue has much information and is necessary 
to rewrite it before moving to the backlog. The maintainer will be responsible 
for it and in the new issue it will add a reference to the original one.
- **Design Handoff:** If you fixed a Figma bug, prepare the handoff following the
guidelines and post the files in the issue. For bugs restricted to Figma, a
maintainer will merge the component or icon branch in the Figma library. For bug
fixes that will need to be implemented, besides merging the branch, the maintainer
will move the issue to the Shoreline Backlog, so that a developer can volunteer
to implement it.

After that, the issue will be tagged with the label `status: active` which means that it is ready to be resolved.

## Submit a proposal

Submitting a proposal means that you've already designed a solution and want to share it with the community. 

![Feature proposal flow](/assets/feature-proposal.png)

Your proposal can have two origins:
- **You have an idea that you’ve already executed and want to start a discussion
about it.** Remember to question yourself before submitting the proposal if the
solution brings significant value to Shoreline and its users.
- **You find an existing issue with a `design wanted` or `dev wanted` tags and
volunteer yourself to work on it.** Before moving on with volunteering, ask
yourself if you're clear on the scope of the project, if the task is feasible for
you to do, and if you would need to collaborate with someone else. Feel free to 
ask any questions!

If everything is clear, move on with submitting your proposal:

**Step 1: Open a GitHub issue in the Shoreline repository**

Use the [proposal template](https://github.com/vtex/shoreline/issues/new/choose) and answer important questions like the problem you
are solving, your solution, and the references you had. If the proposal is
related to an existing issue, remember to mention it. Don't worry if your proposal
is not finalized yet! Share it and start a discussion as early as possible.

**Step 2: Discussion**

You can get feedback through comments on the GitHub issue or by attending office hours.
As you make progress, make sure to update your issue.

**Step 3: Definition**

As the discussions and refinements occur, your issue can be classified as valid to be resolved or not.
- **If it is valid and it is a design proposal:** Prepare the handoff following
the guidelines and post the files in the issue. After that, a maintainer will
merge the component or icon in the Figma library and will move the issue to the
Shoreline Backlog, so that a developer can volunteer to implement it.
- **If it is valid and it is an engineering proposal:** If the issue is in great
shape and is good to read, a maintainer will move it to the Shoreline Backlog. 
If the issue has too much information, a maintainer will create a new issue
summarizing the previous one and will move it to the Shoreline Backlog.

After that, the issue will be tagged with the label `status: active` which means that it is ready to be resolved.

## Request a feature

Requesting a feature means that you have an idea that you want to share with the 
community. You can request a feature in Figma or code.

![Feature request flow](/assets/feature-request.png)

**Step 1: Open a GitHub issue in the Shoreline repository**

Use the [feature request](https://github.com/vtex/shoreline/issues/new/choose) template and answer important questions about the feature
like what is the context, how can we benefit from it, and the rationale behind it. 
If you already have a potential solution to this issue don’t forget to share it.
Don't worry if you aren’t sure about the issue! Share it and start a discussion as early 
as possible.

**Step 2: Discussion**

You can get feedback through comments on the GitHub issue. Make sure to share 
all the necessary information about the feature so the community can help giving
insights and sharing their context as well. As you make progress, make sure to
update your issue.

**Step 3: Definition**

As the discussions and refinements occur, your issue can be classified as valid to
be resolved or not.

If the issue is valid and needs a design proposal, it will be tagged as `design:wanted` and the designer will be responsible for starting a [proposal flow](https://shoreline.vtex.com/guides/processes#submit-a-proposal).

For other scenarios, if the issue is valid it can have two destinations.

- **Shoreline backlog:** The issue is in great shape and is good to read, so it can be
moved to the backlog by a maintainer.
- **Summarize in a new issue:** The issue has much information and is necessary 
to rewrite it before moving to the backlog. The maintainer will be responsible 
for it and in the new issue it will add a reference to the original one.

After that, the issue will be tagged with the label `status: active` which means
that it is ready to be resolved. Keep in mind that when requesting a feature
the issue can be tackled by a maintainer, the community or even you.


## Ask a question or send a feedback

Asking a question or sending a feedback means that you have something to share with
maintainers or the community that probably is bothering you. Feel free to reach
us anytime you need!

**Step 1: Open a GitHub issue in the Shoreline repository**

Use the question template and answer important questions about your submition
like how we can help, what have you tried, and any additional information. Don't
be shy! Share it and start a discussion as early as possible.

**Step 2: Discussion**

You can get feedback through comments on the GitHub issue. Make sure to share 
all the necessary information about the feature so the community can help giving
insights and sharing their context as well. As you make progress, make sure to
update your issue.

**Step 3: Definition**

The idea here is that your issue act as a forum for discussion and resource for
others that might have the same question. If the issue is resolved, a maintainer
will close it.

It may be that your question or feedback can be used as a reference for a future
feature request or potential bug fix, in this case the issue will be summarized in
a new one and moved to the Shoreline backlog. After that, the issue will be tagged
with the label status: active which means that it is ready to be resolved. Keep in
mind that in this case the issue can be tackled by a maintainer, the community or even you.
