## Requirements for Child Components

To be cloned and extended, custom components must be extensible. All components in Shoreline adhere to this requirement and can be used as children for composable components. The criteria for a component to be extensible include:

1. Forward a Ref: Components need to forward a [ref](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef).
2. Forward Received Props: Components must forward the props they receive.

### Extensible Component Example

Here is an example of an extensible component:

```
const CustomComponent = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const { name, ...otherProps } = props

  return (
    <div {...otherProps} ref={ref}>
      {name}
    </div>
  )
})
```

This component successfully forwards a ref and ensures that all received props are also forwarded. This adherence to extensibility makes it compatible as a child for composable components in the Shoreline library.
