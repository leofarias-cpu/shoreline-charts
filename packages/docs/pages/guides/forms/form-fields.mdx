# Form Fields

Single input components in Shoreline don't have labels or help messages by default, in order to build a field to be used on a form you must use the [Field](/components/field/api-reference) compound components set.

## Labels and help text

In order to be accessible, fields in a form should have labels, and in use cases where we want to provide more information fields must have helper text. In Shoreline you can use `Label` and `FieldDescription` to add those elements to a field.

```tsx
<Field>
  <Label>Label</Label>
  <InputElement />
  <FieldDescription>Short description</FieldDescription>
</Field>
```

## Indicating error

Some fields might have error states when a value is invalid. You can use `FieldError` and the `error` prop in `Field` to indicate a form error.

Since `Field` provides context to its children components `FieldError` won't be rendered when the error prop is set to false.

```tsx
<Field error>
  <Label>Label</Label>
  <InputElement />
  <FieldError>Short description</FieldError>
</Field>
```
