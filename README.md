## Install and build dependencies

```bash
pnpm i && pnpm build
```

## Run a command

```bash
pnpm test # [*] runs all tests from all components at once
pnpm clean # [*] useful if you want to clean all packages at once - since they are linked, sometimes a rebase not followed by a fresh reinstall can cause some issues
pnpm dev:storybook # [components package] runs its storybook alongside the styles package
pnpm dev:docs # [docs package] runs the docs website
```
