## How to develop locally?

After you clone this repo, run the following commands to install the dependencies and build the packages:

```bash
pnpm i && pnpm build
```

Now you can run any of the following commands to run the desired package:

```bash
pnpm dev # [*] runs all packages at once <- don't use it
pnpm test # [*] runs all tests from all components at once
pnpm clean # [*] useful if you want to clean all packages at once - since they are linked, sometimes a rebase not followed by a fresh reinstall can cause some issues
pnpm dev:storybook # [components package] runs its storybook alongside the styles package
pnpm dev:docs # [docs package] runs the docs website
```

### Components development

To develop components, you can use the `pnpm dev:storybook` command. It will run the Storybook for the components package and the styles package at the same time. The styles package is a dependency of the components package, so it will be linked to it and any changes you make to the styles package will be reflected in the components package.
