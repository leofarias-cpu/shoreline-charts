# **Admin UI Skeleton**

Skeletons represent a UI that doesnâ€™t contain actual content; instead, it shows the loading elements of a page in a shape similar to the actual content.

- It shows users that content is loading, offering a vague preview of how content will look once it fully loads.
- It's being used internally by AdminUI to handle the loading state of specific components.

## Usage

By default, the `Skeleton` is fluid, which means that both width and height are `100%` of its container.

- **Fluid Example**

<Canvas>
  <Story id="beta-skeleton--fluid" />
</Canvas>

- **Rect Example**

<Canvas>
  <Story id="beta-skeleton--rect" />
</Canvas>

- **Circle Example**

<Canvas>
  <Story id="beta-skeleton--circle" />
</Canvas>

## Props

<Props of={Skeleton} />
