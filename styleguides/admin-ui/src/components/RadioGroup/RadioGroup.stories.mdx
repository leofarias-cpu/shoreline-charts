## **RadioGroup Label**

You can easily add a label using the `label` prop, but it is also possible to add a custom one, or even not add any label (just remember to use `aria-label` prop, in this case).

- **Custom Label**

<Canvas>
  <Story id="alpha-radiogroup--without-label-prop" />
</Canvas>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è To guarantee accessibility, always that a `RadioGroup` has a label, it should have an `id` set as well.

## **RadioGroup children**

Components with `role="radiogroup"` should have children of type `Radio`. We don't do this restriction on the code, so you should keep in mind that when using the `RadioGroup` the children should be of `Radio` type.

### **Child label**

The labels involved by `RadioGroup` are customized with `display="flex"` and `items="center"` by default. You can override these styles if necessary.

### **Usage**

<Canvas>
  <Story id="alpha-radiogroup--horizontal" />
</Canvas>
