# Admin UI RadiouGroup

Used to group `Radio` components.

## **Usage**

<Canvas>
  <Story id="alpha-radiogroup--vertical" />
</Canvas>

## **Props**

<Props of={RadioGroup} />

## **RadioGroup Label**

You can easily add a label using the `label` prop.

- **Without using label prop**

If you want to add a custom label, that differs of the defined one in the `label` prop, it is possible.

**Example:**

<Canvas>
  <Story id="alpha-radiogroup--without-label-prop" />
</Canvas>

> ⚠️ To guarantee accessibility, always that a `RadioGroup` has a label, it should have an `id` set as well.

## **RadioGroup children**

Components with `role="radiogroup"` should have children of type `Radio`. We don't do this restriction on the code, so you should keep in mind that when using the `RadioGroup` the children should be of `Radio` type.

### **Child label**

The labels involved by `RadioGroup` are customized with `display="flex"` and `items="center"` by default. This doesn't imply that you can't override these styles.

### **Usage Example**

<Canvas>
  <Story id="alpha-radiogroup--horizontal" />
</Canvas>
