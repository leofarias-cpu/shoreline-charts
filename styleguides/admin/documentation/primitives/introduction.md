# Introduction

Our design system comes with a set of "layout compnents" which are components to help you build commonly layouts inside your application.

## Components Overview

- <highlight message="Box:"></highlight> To create a basic columned layout, add a `<Columns>` component and then add your `<Columns.Item>`.
- <highlight message="Skeleton:"></highlight> A `<Set>` can be used to list a set of components, and it will automatically space out the components.
