# Button

Buttons trigger an action, or allow the user to advance a state. They are where the user interacts with the screen.
This component handles all `Button` variations of the Design System. It renders a `<button>` element by default.

## UX Writing: Tone and Voice

Keep in mind the Authority we want to transmit with our voice. Buttons are where the action takes place. We're always sure where we want to direct our users to, so they accomplish their goals. There's no space for ambiguity in the actions we guide them to take, we convey decisiveness.

## Behavior

```jsx
<Button>Admin UI Button</Button>
```

## Installation

```sh isStatic
yarn add @vtex/admin-ui
```

```jsx isStatic
import { Button } from '@vtex/admin-ui'
```

- No punctuation.

```jsx
<Set orientation="vertical">
  <Button icon={<IconFavorite />} iconPosition="start" mr="20px">
    Icon start
  </Button>
  <Button icon={<IconCaret direction="down" />} iconPosition="end">
    Icon end
  </Button>
</Set>
```
