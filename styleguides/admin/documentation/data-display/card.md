# Card

Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic.

## Import

```jsx isStatic
import { Card } from '@vtex/admin-ui'
```

## Behavior

```jsx
<Card>
  <Set orientation="vertical" spacing={3} fluid>
    <Heading>Build for community</Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      It’s all about being ready to grow and reach new levels. Have a solid
      foundation, modular thinking and flexible essence, and you’re building for
      scale. We are global but we’re audacious enough to aim for the stars.
    </Paragraph>
  </Set>
</Card>
```

Same as [Box](/primitives/box/).
