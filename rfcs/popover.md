# Summary

`Popover` is a non-modal dialog that floats around its disclosure. Popovers contain helpful information such as an explanation of a context.

# Basic example

```jsx
import { Popover } from '@brand-ui/popover'

<Popover size="small">
  <p>This is a Popover</p>
</Popover>
```

# Detailed design

| prop | type        | description           | default     | required |
| ---- | ----------- | --------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| size | PopoverSize | sizing of the popover | `'regular'` | ðŸš«       |

PopoverSize = `'small'` | `'regular'`

# Adoption strategy

- This is a new feature, no breaking changes to any packages in `onda`.

# Education

- As with any DS component, it must be documented.

# Unresolved questions

- Missing specification about positioning the Popover.
- Missing other usage examples.
